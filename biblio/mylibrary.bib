  abstract = {Critical thinking (CT) is purposeful, self-regulatory judgment that results in interpretation, analysis, evaluation, and inference, as well as explanations of the considerations on which that judgment is based. This article summarizes the available empirical evidence on the impact of instruction on the development and enhancement of critical thinking skills and dispositions and student achievement. The review includes 341 effects sizes drawn from quasi- or true-experimental studies that used standardized measures of CT as outcome variables. The weighted random effects mean effect size (g+) was 0.30 (p {$<$} .001). The collection was heterogeneous (p {$<$} .001). Results demonstrate that there are effective strategies for teaching CT skills, both generic and content specific, and CT dispositions, at all educational levels and across all disciplinary areas. Notably, the opportunity for dialogue, the exposure of students to authentic or situated problems and examples, and mentoring had positive effects on CT skills.},

In general, artificial colorants have lower cost and better stability than the natural ones. Nevertheless, studies have reported their association with some health disorders. Furthermore, consumers have given greater attention to food products with health beneficial effects, which has provided a new perspective for the use of natural colorants. In this context, fruits are an excellent alternative source of natural compounds, that allow the obtainment of a wide range of colorant molecules, such as anthocyanins, betalains, carotenoids, and chlorophylls. Furthermore, in addition to their coloring ability, they comprise different bioactive properties. However, the extraction and application of natural colorants from fruits is still a challenge, since these compounds show some stability problems, in addition to issues related to the sustainability of raw-materials providing. To overcome these limitations, several studies have reported optimized extraction and stabilization procedures. In this review, the major pigments found in fruits and their extraction and stabilization techniques for uses as food additives will be looked over.},

Traits measured were number of eggs collected, egg weight, amount of feed taken from the feed troughs, body weight gain, fertility of eggs, feather pecking and comb damage scores, leukocyte count, plasma corticosterone level, and adrenal gland weight. During the 2-month experimental period, blind hens produced 12.7\% more eggs (hen-day production) while requiring 44.1 g less feed per bird per day compared to sighted hens. There was no significant difference in body weight gained between the two genotypes. Significant genotype × flock size and genotype × density interactions also indicated that the performance of the blind chickens was less affected by differences in density and flock size compared with sighted chickens. Other traits measured provided evidence that the blind chickens were less active, had better feather coverage, and were perhaps under less stress than sighted ones.},

Drawing on research questioning the use of big data in social science and reception studies, we identify six misconceptions about misinformation and examine the conceptual and methodological challenges they raise. The first three misconceptions concern the prevalence and circulation of misinformation. First, the internet is not rife with misinformation or news, but with memes and entertaining content. Second, scientists focused on social media because it is methodologically convenient, but misinformation is not just a social media problem. Third, falsehoods don’t spread faster than the truth, how we define (mis)information influences our results and their practical implications. The second three misconceptions concern the impact and the reception of misinformation. First, people don’t believe everything they see on the internet: sheer volume of engagement should not be conflated with belief. Second, misinformation’s influence on people’s behavior is overblown since it often preaches to the choir. Third, people are more likely to be uninformed than misinformed, surveys overestimate misperceptions and say little about the causal influence of misinformation. To appropriately understand and fight misinformation, future research needs to address these challenges.},

  abstract = {Clusters of unvaccinated children are particularly susceptible to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable disease1,2. Existing messaging interventions demonstrate short-term success, but some may backfire and worsen vaccine hesitancy3. Values-based messages appeal to core morality, which influences the attitudes individuals then have on topics like vaccination4–7. We must understand how underlying morals, not just attitudes, differ by hesitancy type to develop interventions that work with individual values. Here, we show in two correlational studies that harm and fairness foundations are not significantly associated with vaccine hesitancy, but purity and liberty foundations are. We found that medium-hesitancy parents were twice as likely as low-hesitancy parents to highly emphasize purity (adjusted odds ratio: 2.08; 95\% confidence interval: 1.27–3.40). High-hesitancy respondents were twice as likely to strongly emphasize purity (adjusted odds ratio: 2.15; 95\% confidence interval: 1.39–3.31) and liberty (adjusted odds ratio: 2.19; 95\% confidence interval: 1.50–3.21). Our results demonstrate that endorsement of harm and fairness—ideas often emphasized in traditional vaccine-focused messages—are not predictive of vaccine hesitancy. This, combined with significant associations of purity and liberty with hesitancy, indicates a need for inclusion of broader themes in vaccine discussions. These findings have the potential for application to other health decisions and communications as well.},

  abstract = {Parental child-related spending represents an important pathway to promote children’s human capital development and material well-being. It is also, however, a pathway that perpetuates social inequalities given the well-known socioeconomic divide in parental spending on children. Although several studies have documented the extent to which current family income is associated with spending on children, we still know little about the causal effects of additional income on child-related spending across the socioeconomic strata. In this paper, I examine the effects of income gains due to universal and unconditional cash transfers from the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend on child-related spending. Using longitudinal household expenditure data from the 1996–2015 Consumer Expenditure Surveys, I exploit exogenous variation in the generosity of the Alaska Dividend to estimate short- and long-term disparities in parental expenditures resulting from payouts. Results provide a unique opportunity to compare the behavior of high- and low-income parents after an income boost. I find that low- and middle-income parents use cash transfers to catch up with their more affluent counterparts in the short and long term. Low-income parents are, however, unable to keep up with the long-term increases in child-related spending made by their middle-income counterparts. Implications of results for the reproduction of socioeconomic inequalities and for current and proposed cash-transfer policies are discussed.},

Avant tout outil d’aide à la gestion des données d’un projet de recherche et à la définition de bonnes pratiques, il s’agit également d’un livrable à usage externe, dont la rédaction est exigée par de nombreux financeurs de la recherche. L’ANR (depuis 2019) et la Commission européenne (depuis 2014), entre autres, exigent des chercheurs qui soumettent une demande de financement qu’ils fournissent un plan de gestion détaillé des données de recherche qu’ils comptent utiliser. Ce document témoigne de la bonne gestion des données au cours du projet et il permet de déterminer quelles données de recherche pourront être mises à la disposition du plus grand nombre, dans un souci de transparence scientifique et de partage des savoirs. Mais à quoi ressemble exactement un PGD ? Quelles sont les informations indispensables à y inscrire ? Existe-t-il des modèles ? Comment inscrire ce travail chronophage dans un projet de recherche et le valoriser ? Est-ce vraiment bien utile ? \#\#\# Objectifs Cette formation vise à présenter en détails le concept de « plan de gestion des données » et à expliciter en quoi ce document, qui peut apparaître à première vue comme un fardeau administratif supplémentaire, peut en réalité apporter de nouvelles pistes de réflexion dans la recherche. L’objectif de cette journée est de permettant aux producteurs de données de s’interroger sur les bonnes pratiques à adopter à toutes les étapes de leur projet, qu’il s’agisse d’un projet financé ou d’une thèse de doctorat. La formation sera également l’occasion de découvrir les nombreuses ressources et outils qui sont à la disposition des doctorants et des chercheurs pour faciliter leur rédaction, ainsi que les options qui s’offrent à eux pour valoriser ce travail.~ À l’issue de la formation, le stagiaire sera capable de : 1.~~ ~Donner une définition de ce qu’est un plan de gestion des données 2.~~ ~Citer les questions auxquelles doit répondre un PGD 3.~~ ~Discerner les cas dans lesquels la rédaction d’un PGD est obligatoire de ceux dans lesquels il n’est qu’utile 4.~~ ~Comprendre en quoi la rédaction d’un PGD participe du mouvement de la science ouverte (open science) 5.~~ ~Utiliser l’outil DMP-OPIDoR pour rédiger un plan de gestion des données 6.~~ ~Connaître les critères selon lesquels la Commission européenne évalue un PGD, et auto-évaluer son propre PGD 7.~~ ~Donner une définition de ce que sont un data paper et un data journal, et savoir où trouver de telles ressources \#\# PROGRAMME 1.~~ ~Quelques rappels sur les données de la recherche 2.~~ ~Le PGD en théorie : définition et modèles 3.~~ ~Le PGD en pratique : guide de rédaction et étude de plans rédigés 4.~~ ~Le PGD en pratique : un retour d’expérience de rédaction 5.~~ ~Boîte à outils : prise en main de DMP OPIDoR 6.~~ ~Valoriser son PGD : introduction aux data papers \#\# PRÉ-REQUIS Savoir utiliser un navigateur web. Cette formation est destinée aux personnes déjà un peu familières du concept de données de la recherche, quel que soit leur degré d’avancement dans leurs travaux de recherche.~ \#\# TYPE D'INTERVENTION Exposé, démonstration, travaux pratiques, échanges \#\#\# Logistique - Vidéo-projecteur : support de présentation - Activités : exercices à imprimer ou à faire en ligne si la salle est équipée \#\# SOURCES Les images de ce dépôt sont créditées dans le support de formation.

  abstract = {The effect of artificial food colors (AFCs) on child behavior has been studied for more than 35~years, with accumulating evidence from imperfect studies. This article summarizes the history of this controversial topic and testimony to the 2011 Food and Drug Administration Food Advisory Committee convened to evaluate the current status of evidence regarding attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Features of ADHD relevant to understanding the AFC literature are explained: ADHD is a quantitative diagnosis, like hypertension, and some individuals near the threshold may be pushed over it by a small symptom increment. The chronicity and pervasiveness make caregiver ratings the most valid measure, albeit subjective. Flaws in many studies include nonstandardized diagnosis, questionable sample selection, imperfect blinding, and nonstandardized outcome measures. Recent data suggest a small but significant deleterious effect of AFCs on children's behavior that is not confined to those with diagnosable ADHD. AFCs appear to be more of a public health problem than an ADHD problem. AFCs are not a major cause of ADHD per se, but seem to affect children regardless of whether or not they have ADHD, and they may have an aggregated effect on classroom climate if most children in the class suffer a small behavioral decrement with additive or synergistic effects. Possible biological mechanisms with published evidence include the effects on nutrient levels, genetic vulnerability, and changes in electroencephalographic beta-band power. A table clarifying the Food and Drug Administration and international naming systems for AFCs, with cross-referencing, is provided.},

  abstract = {Autism has been increasing dramatically since its description by Leo Kanner in 1943. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2018 has identified 1 in 59 children (1 in 37 boys and 1 in 151 girls) has autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Autistic spectrum disorders and ADHD are complex conditions in which nutritional and environmental factors play major roles. It is important to understand how food can have an impact on their current and future health. Appealing food colors stimulate the consumption of different food products. Since 2011, it is evident that dyes are linked to harmful effects in children. Artificial dyes have neurotoxic chemicals that aggravate mental health problems. Many families with autistic children avoid food dyes in their diet in order to avoid behavioral issues. A study reported that there is a correlation between yellow dye and sleep disturbance. Food colors Blue 1 and 2, Green 3, Red 3, Yellow 5 and 6, Citrus Red 2, and Red 40 can trigger many behaviors in most kids. Artificial food color usually contains petroleum and is manufactured in a chemical process that includes formaldehyde, aniline, hydroxides, and sulfuric acids. Most impurities in the food color are in the form of salts or acids. Sometimes lead, arsenic, and mercury may be present as impurities. The U.S. FDA is yet to study the effects of synthetic dyes on behavior in children. A study conducted at Southampton University in England found a link between food dyes and hyperactive behavior in children. The research does not prove that food coloring actually causes autism spectrum disorder, but there seems to be a link. This chapter attempts to provide a broad review of the available literature on food color and the epidemiology, etiology, prevention, and treatment of autistic spectrum disorder.},

This study assesses the percentage of grocery store products marketed to children that contain AFCs, by category and company. The research team collected product and food-color information about 810 products in one grocery store in North Carolina in 2014. Overall, 350 products (43.2\%) contained AFCs. The most common AFCs were Red 40 (29.8\% of products), Blue 1 (24.2\%), Yellow 5 (20.5\%), and Yellow 6 (19.5\%). Produce was the only category that did not have any AFCs. The highest percentage of products with AFCs was found in candies (96.3\%), fruit-flavored snacks (94\%), and drink mixes/powders (89.7\%). Forty-one of the 66 companies marketed products containing AFCs. Given concerns about health effects of AFCs and high proportions of high-AFC categories, clinicians, parents, food companies, and the government can take steps to support children's healthy eating and development by reducing AFCs in children's diets.},

To cultivate critical thinkers, librarians continue to build innovative practices, even as technology rapidly evolves. However, the pervasiveness of misinformation and disinformation, most recently seen in the conspiratorial worldviews of QAnon, challenges librarians to center critical thinking in their information literacy praxis. In this article, we provide a concise overview of QAnon and the problems that contemporary internet conspiracy theories like it pose. We offer an epistemological shift for information literacy, from heuristics to mindsets and behaviors, drawing on disciplines external to librarianship. Finally, we consider the role that emotions play in the promotion and spread of conspiracism. Equipping librarians with a better understanding of conspiracy thinking and the tools to counter it will in turn empower the next generation of critical thinkers.},

Pre´sente´e comme un outil majeur de lutte contre  la radicalisation et les fausses informations, l'EMI est devenue un e´le´ment central  de nombreux discours institutionnels. Elle ne peut pourtant se re´sumer a` ces objectifs.  Le collectif La Friche, compose´ de quatre journalistes inde´pendants, et l'association  E´dume´dias proposent de la rapprocher de l'un de ses lieux fondateurs : l'e´ducation  populaire. A travers des entretiens, des retours d'expe´riences et des analyses plus  the´oriques c'est une lecture critique de la socie´te´ et de ses repre´sentations  me´diatiques qui se dessine, pour repenser la fabrique me\^me de l'information. La  Friche est un collectif roubaisien de quatre journalistes inde´pendants : Lucas Roxo,  Flora Beillouin, Sheerazad Chekaik, Julien Pitinome. Fortement impre´gne´ par l'e´ducation  populaire, le collectif organise des ateliers et des formations d'e´ducation aux me´dias  et a` l'information aupre`s de publics habituellement e´loigne´s des canaux traditionnels  de diffusion de l'information.

Dans la profusion de textes écrits après novembre 2016, tous s’accordent sur l'idée que les fake news sont un «~mal du siècle~» contre lequel les bibliothécaires ont vocation à s'engager. Sur ce point, si la question des moyens se pose, ce n’est pas le cas de la légitimité en tant que bibliothécaire à intervenir dans ce champ. Comment, en effet, ne pas voir des deux côtés de l’Atlantique la question des fake news comme un prolongement de celle de «~l’évaluation de l’information~» qui apparaît depuis les années~90 dans le corpus des enseignements délivrés par les formateurs en bibliothèque. Le sésame «~fake news~» permet donc de donner un nouveau lustre à ces apprentissages, même si l'objet a un peu changé au passage. À l'origine, en effet, les efforts se focalisaient sur la notion d’autorité et la spécificité du texte scientifique –~ou comment permettre aux étudiants de mieux le distinguer d'une information vulgarisée. Dans un premier temps, il a fallu persuader l'université que la légitimité fondée sur une abondance de sources valides pouvait valoir celle d'un auteur reconnu dans sa discipline.

  abstract = {Despite the scientific consensus about the anthropogenic nature of climate change, there are still obstacles hindering society from acknowledging the severity of the situation. Notably, previous research suggests that climate change threats can cause people to display ethnocentric reaction to preserve the ingroup’s interests. In this research, we investigate the relation between collective narcissism and attitudes towards climate science. We argue that national collective narcissism is negatively associated with the acceptance of climate science. We further hypothesized that this relation might be mediated by conspiracy beliefs about climate change, because narcissistic identifiers are prone to hold conspiracy beliefs. In a pilot Study (N = 409), we found that national collective narcissism was significantly associated with climate change conspiracy beliefs. In Study 1 (N = 295), climate change conspiracy beliefs mediated the negative relation between national collective narcissism and acceptance of climate science. In Study 2 (N = 375), this mediation was replicated when controlling for other forms of climate skepticism. Lastly, general conspiracy mentality did not mediate this relation, which emphasizes the importance of considering the specificity of climate change conspiracy theories (rather than generic propensity to believe in conspiracy theories) in understanding distrust toward climate science.},

  abstract = {« Nous étouffons parmi des gens qui pensent avoir absolument raison », disait Albert Camus, et nous sommes nombreux à ressentir la même chose aujourd’hui, tant l’air devient proprement irrespirable. Les réseaux sociaux sont un théâtre d’ombres où le débat est souvent remplacé par l’invective : chacun, craignant d’y rencontrer un contradicteur, préfère traquer cent ennemis. Au-delà même de Twitter ou de Facebook, le champ intellectuel et politique se confond avec un champ de bataille où tous les coups sont permis. Partout de féroces prêcheurs préfèrent attiser les haines plutôt qu’éclairer les esprits.Avec ce livre, Jean Birnbaum veut apporter du réconfort à toutes les femmes, tous les hommes qui refusent la «brutalisation» de notre débat public et qui veulent préserver l’espace d’une discussion aussi franche qu’argumentée. Pour cela, il relit les textes de quelques intellectuels et écrivains qui ne se sont jamais contentés d’opposer l’idéologie à l’idéologie, les slogans aux slogans. Renouer avec Albert Camus, George Orwell, Hannah Arendt, Raymond Aron, Georges Bernanos, Germaine Tillion ou encore Roland Barthes, ce n’est pas seulement trouver refuge auprès de figures aimées, qui permettent de tenir bon, de se tenir bien. C’est surtout retrouver l’espoir et la capacité de proclamer ceci : dans le brouhaha des évidences, il n’y a pas plus radical que la nuance.},

From social media to academia, public speech to casual conversation, the word is utilized to brand people of all kinds with a term once reserved exclusively for those who came from wealth and old money―inherited advantage.Today “privileged” applies to anyone who enjoys an unearned advantage in life, inherited or not. White privilege, male privilege, straight privilege―those conditions make everyday life easier, less stressful, more lucrative, and generally better for those who hold one, two, or all three designations. But what about white female privilege in the context of feminism? Or fixed gender privilege in the context of transgender? Or weight and height privilege in the context of hiring practices and salary levels? Or food privilege in the context of widening inequality for single-parent families?In The Perils of “Privilege,” Phoebe Maltz Bovy examines the rise of this word into extraordinary potency. Does calling out privilege help to change or soften it? Or simply reinforce it by dividing people against themselves? And is privilege a concept that, in fact, only privileged people are debating? The Perils of “Privilege” explores how this word is deployed, and offers ways to begin anew so many of the conversations it has silenced.},

Two hypothetical students’ document evaluation strategy protocols were designed: One featured more sophisticated strategies commonly enacted by experts and better college students and a second featured less sophisticated strategies commonly enacted by secondary school students. A series of classroom-based activities required that students compare/contrast the two protocols to decide which were the best strategies when analyzing multiple scientific documents and why. The findings demonstrated that students who previously participated in the intervention activities included more scientific concepts from more useful documents when generating essay responses from memory, displayed better rankings of the usefulness of the set of multiple documents, and offered more principled justifications based on source feature evaluations of trustworthiness compared to students who instead received typical classroom instruction. We discuss the instructional implications of a contrasting-cases approach in facilitating secondary school students’ usage of source features within multiple-documents inquiry contexts.},

At three such enriched habitats in Monterey Bay, CA, at a depth of nearly 3000 m, we observed pycnogonids (sea spiders) of at least two species, Colossendeis gigas and C. japonica, feeding on sea anemones that were commonly found there. Submersible remotely operated vehicles provided direct observations of feeding, as well as high definition video and photographic images. We recorded the co-occurrence of both pycnogonids and prey anemones during ten of 12 visits during 2002–2006. Anemones and pycnogonids were conspicuously more abundant at these oases than in the surrounding benthos. The sedentary anemone Anthosactis pearseae was attached directly to whalebones while the pom-pom anemone, Liponema brevicornis, was found resting on soft sediment, rolling in benthic currents, or accumulating where these currents were disrupted by topography, as at whale falls, wood falls, and clam fields. Both pycnogonid species were observed feeding on these anemones, either as predators or as micropredators.},

Multiple genes have been reported to be linked to monogenic PD but these only explain a fraction of the observed familial aggregation. Rare variants in RIC3 have been suggested to be associated with PD in the Indian population. However, replication studies yielded inconsistent results. We further investigate the role of RIC3 variants in PD in European cohorts using individual-level genotyping data from 14,671 PD patients and 17,667 controls, as well as whole-genome sequencing data from 1,615 patients and 961 controls. We also investigated RIC3 using summary statistics from a Latin American cohort of 1,481 individuals, and from a cohort of 31,575 individuals of East Asian ancestry. We did not identify any association between RIC3 and PD in any of the cohorts. However, more studies of rare variants in non-European ancestry populations, in particular South Asian populations, are necessary to further evaluate the world-wide role of RIC3 in PD etiology.},

  abstract = {Key points{$<$}list id="tjp6378-list-0001" list-type="bulleted"{$>$} Hyperactivity of the stress system and low-grade immune activation characterize the functional bowel disorder irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). These studies show that interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 and the stress hormone corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), present in IBS plasma, have functional effects on gastrointestinal activity by stimulating myenteric neurons and colonic contractions. Moreover, in the Wistar Kyoto rat model of IBS, which exhibits altered gastrointestinal motility and visceral pain sensitivity, blocking IL-6 and/or CRF1 receptors alleviates these IBS-like symptoms. Underlying these effects are altered colonic protein expression of tight junction proteins which regulate gut barrier function and the T-type calcium channel Ca(V)3.2, which has been linked to visceral pain. These findings demonstrate the importance of the enteric nervous system and intestinal physiology in bowel dysfunction. AbstractThe search for effective therapeutic strategies for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is hampered by an incomplete understanding of its underlying pathophysiology. Stress and altered plasma cytokine profiles indicative of immune activation are characteristic of the disorder. The neuromodulatory effects of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and corticotropin-releasing factor receptor (CRFR) 1 in visceral pain and stress-induced defecation in the Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rat model of IBS were investigated. Sprague Dawley and WKY rats were administered anti-IL-6 receptor antibodies (xIL-6R, 0.5mgkg(-1) i.p) with or without the CRFR1 antagonist antalarmin (10mgkg(-1) i.p). Post-intervention, the pain threshold to colorectal distension and stress-induced faecal output were compared and changes in colonic mucosal protein expression were investigated. The neuro-stimulatory effects of IBS plasma on the myenteric plexus is mediated by IL-6, IL-8 and CRF. The stimulatory effects of these soluble factors on myenteric neuron excitability and colonic contractility were additive. Moreover, inhibition of IL-6 and CRF1 receptors in vivo in the WKY IBS rat model normalized stress-induced defecation (P{$<$}0.01) and visceral pain sensitivity (P{$<$}0.001) with associated changes in protein expression of the tight junction proteins occludin and claudin 2, the visceral pain-associated T-type calcium channel Ca(V)3.2 and intracellular signalling molecules STAT3, SOCS3 and ERK1/2. These studies demonstrate the additive effects of immune and stress factors on myenteric neuronal excitability. Moreover, combined targeting of peripheral IL-6 and CRF1 receptors is effective in alleviating IBS-like symptoms in the WKY rat. Thus, crosstalk between stress and immune factors during IBS flares may underlie symptom exacerbation.},

  abstract = {In recent decades, changing lifestyles in Canadian homes has led to demand for foods with long shelf lives that are cosmetically appealing, palatable, easy to prepare and to consume. Food additives, especially preservatives and artificial colours as well as suboptimal intake of essential nutrients, have been linked to hyperactive behaviours and poor attention in a subgroup of children. Although other risk factors (ie, genetic, etc) for these conditions have received more attention in the scientific literature, the authors believe that there is enough evidence to consider dietary influences as a modifiable risk factor. This would involve raising awareness among clinicians and, subsequently, reviewing food regulatory processes to better protect children in Canada - similar to the regulations recently undertaken by the British Food Standards Agency. Conflicts of interest due to food and medication industry support for organizations advocating for children would need to be resolved by open communication between government regulatory agencies, academia and industry. Canadian parents and children need to be advised to limit unnecessary food additives and consume a diet rich in essential nutrients while more complete relationships are being explored further.},

La confiance peut être regagnée en traitant le problème à la racine : la propriété des médias. Comment les citoyens peuvent-ils accorder leur confiance aux médias si aucune règle claire n’empêche un actionnaire d’interférer dans le fonctionnement des rédactions ou de faire licencier un journaliste qui lui déplaît ? Doit-on se satisfaire d'une situation dans laquelle une poignée d'industriels possèdent la quasi-totalité des médias, limitant le pluralisme d’opinions et appauvrissant d’autant le débat public ? Est-il acceptable que les journalistes ne soient pas consultés lorsque leur titre est vendu à tel ou tel « mécène » ? Il n’existe pas de fatalité à ce que les médias se vident de leurs journalistes au fil de leurs rachats successifs par des industriels. L’information est un bien public dont la production doit être confiée à des journalistes disposant d’une véritable indépendance éditoriale, et nous pensons que cette indépendance est possible en adoptant de nouvelles règles. Ce livre vise à armer les citoyens, les journalistes et les régulateurs en faisant toute la lumière sur les différentes formes de propriété des médias et les limites des régulations existantes. Il ne s’agit pas de questions techniques, mais des fondamentaux d’un débat démocratique éclairé. Pour cela, nous proposons une loi de démocratisation de l'information permettant aux journalistes et aux citoyens de reprendre enfin le contrôle des médias.

  abstract = {Exposure to artificial food colors and additives (AFCAs) has been implicated in the induction and severity of some childhood behavioral and learning disabilities. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nACHRs) are thought to be effective in the learning and memory-generating process. In this study, we investigated the effects of intrauterine exposure to AFCAs on subunit concentrations of NMDARs and nAChRs isoforms in rats. We administered a mixture of AFCAs (Eritrosin, Ponceau 4R, Allura Red AC, Sunset Yellow FCF, Tartrazin, Amaranth, Brilliant Blue, Azoruhin and Indigotin) to female rats before and during gestation. The concentration of NR2A and NR2B subunits and nAChR alpha 7, alpha 4 beta 2 isoforms in their offspring's hippocampi were measured by Western Blotting. Expressions of NR2B and nAChR beta 2 were significantly increased (17\% and 6.70\%, respectively), whereas expression of nAChR alpha 4 was significantly decreased (5.67\%) in male experimental group compared to the male control group (p {$<$} 0.05). In the female experimental group, AFCAs caused a 14\% decrease in NR2B expression when compared to the female control group (p {$<$} 0.05). Our results indicate that exposure to AFCAs during the fetal period may lead to alterations in expressions of NMDARs and nAChRs in adulthood. These alterations were different between male and female genders. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Seven US FDA-batch certified synthetic food colors are approved for use as food additives in the United States. Perceived neurodevelopmental concerns for these colors persist. This study assessed the plausibility of such an association through the evaluation of mechanistic evidence collected from in vitro assays or other alternative models. Mechanisms and molecular targets underlying neurodevelopmental processes associated with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other neurodevelopmental-related symptoms (e.g., cognitive function, learning and memory disorder, etc.) were identified. Publicly available data from the ToxCast/Tox21 high-throughput screening (HTS) program and peer-reviewed literature that measure activity of the colors for such molecular targets were analyzed and reviewed. Erythrosine (Red No. 3) was active in several assays mapped to neurodevelopmental processes - specifically, HTS assays that measure signals in neurotransmitter pathways. The remaining six colors do not appear to alter signaling pathways related to neurodevelopmental processes on the molecular or cellular level. This assessment provides an approach for systematically identifying and mapping mechanistic data to putative neurodevelopmental processes as a means to prioritize substances for possible further investigation. The assessment also provides insights into the lack of activity of synthetic food colors for key events in neurodevelopmental signaling pathways.},

Des pratiques pédagogiques nouvelles ont ainsi vu le jour, notamment autour de la professionnalisation, dont on dégage dans ce texte quelques principes utiles. Toutefois cet article vise, avant tout, à montrer l’importance d’un détour théorique s’appuyant sur différents travaux scientifiques afin de construire un modèle de la compétence qui puisse éclairer l’intervention pédagogique. Il s’agit alors de montrer en quoi une approche par compétences, ainsi outillée, permet d’imaginer de nouvelles pratiques.},

  abstract = {Nowadays more and more attentions are paid to fruit quality in the production of tomato. In order to better understand the effects of deficit irrigation on tomato yield and fruit quality, four years of deficit irrigation experiments were investigated to simulate water-yield and water-fruit quality relationships of tomato in greenhouses. The yield and fruit quality parameters like total soluble solids (TSS), reducing sugars (RS), organic acids (OA), sugar/acid content ratio (SAR), vitamin C (VC), firmness (Fn), color index (CI) were correlated with seasonal evapotranspiration (ET) and ET deficit at flowering and fruit development stage (Stage II) and fruit ripening stage (Stage III) using linear regression. Three water-yield models (Jensen, Stewart, Minhas) and three water-fruit quality models (multiplicative, additive, exponential) were applied to simulate the relationships of tomato yield and fruit quality parameters with water deficit at various growth stages. The water deficit sensitivity indexes (lambda/Ky/delta or gamma/Kq/psi) of the models were calculated with the method of multiply linear regression. The performance and sensitivity analysis of the models were evaluated. Results showed that the relative yield decreased linearly with the drop of relative seasonal ET, mainly due to the yield depression by ET deficit at Stage Hand Stage III; the relative values of fruit quality parameters increased with the drop of relative seasonal ET, mostly because of the enhancement by ET deficit at Stage III. The calculated water deficit sensitivity indexes indicated that both the yield and fruit quality were hardly sensitive to water deficit at Stage I, but sensitive to water deficit at Stage II and that at Stage III; TSS, RS, SAR and VC were much more sensitive to water deficit at Stage III than that at Stage II; RS, SAR and VC were more sensitive to water deficit than TSS, OA, Fn and CI. The Minhas model with its water deficit sensitivity indexes was recommended to simulate wateryield relations of greenhouse tomato in the study area; multiplicative model and additive model were, respectively, recommended to simulate the relationships of fruit quality parameters like TSS, RS, SAR, Fn and fruit quality parameters like OA, VC, CI with water deficit at various growth stages. The water-yield and water-fruit quality models would be helpful to optimally allocate irrigation water during the growth season, thus achieving efficient production of tomato in greenhouses in consideration of the compromise between tomato yield and fruit quality.

  abstract = {It is often argued that cost-sharing—charging a subsidized, positive price— for a health product is necessary to avoid wasting resources on those who will not use or do not need the product. We explore this argument through a field experiment in Kenya, in which we randomized the price at which prenatal clinics could sell long-lasting antimalarial insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) to pregnant women. We find no evidence that cost-sharing reduces wastage on those who will not use the product: women who received free ITNs are not less likely to use them than those who paid subsidized positive prices. We also find no evidence that costsharing induces selection of women who need the net more: those who pay higher prices appear no sicker than the average prenatal client in the area in terms of measured anemia (an important indicator of malaria). Cost-sharing does, however, considerably dampen demand. We find that uptake drops by sixty percentage points when the price of ITNs increases from zero to \$0.60 (i.e., from 100\% to 90\% subsidy), a price still \$0.15 below the price at which ITNs are currently sold to pregnant women in Kenya. We combine our estimates in a cost-effectiveness analysis of the impact of ITN prices on child mortality that incorporates both private and social returns to ITN usage. Overall, our results suggest that free distribution of ITNs could save many more lives than cost-sharing programs have achieved so far, and, given the large positive externality associated with widespread usage of ITNs, would likely do so at a lesser cost per life saved.}

  abstract = {Efforts to make research results open and reproducible are increasingly reflected by journal policies encouraging or mandating authors to provide data availability statements. As a consequence of this, there has been a strong uptake of data availability statements in recent literature. Nevertheless, it is still unclear what proportion of these statements actually contain well-formed links to data, for example via a URL or permanent identifier, and if there is an added value in providing such links. We consider 531, 889 journal articles published by PLOS and BMC, develop an automatic system for labelling their data availability statements according to four categories based on their content and the type of data availability they display, and finally analyze the citation advantage of different statement categories via regression. We find that, following mandated publisher policies, data availability statements become very common. In 2018 93.7\% of 21,793 PLOS articles and 88.2\% of 31,956 BMC articles had data availability statements. Data availability statements containing a link to data in a repository—rather than being available on request or included as supporting information files—are a fraction of the total. In 2017 and 2018, 20.8\% of PLOS publications and 12.2\% of BMC publications provided DAS containing a link to data in a repository. We also find an association between articles that include statements that link to data in a repository and up to 25.36\% (± 1.07\%) higher citation impact on average, using a citation prediction model. We discuss the potential implications of these results for authors (researchers) and journal publishers who make the effort of sharing their data in repositories.

Some are effects of information-processing rules (i.e., mental shortcuts), called heuristics, that the brain uses to produce decisions or judgments. Biases have a variety of forms and appear as cognitive ("cold") bias, such as mental noise, or motivational ("hot") bias, such as when beliefs are distorted by wishful thinking. Both effects can be present at the same time.There are also controversies over some of these biases as to whether they count as useless or irrational, or whether they result in useful attitudes or behavior. For example, when getting to know others, people tend to ask leading questions which seem biased towards confirming their assumptions about the person. However, this kind of confirmation bias has also been argued to be an example of social skill: a way to establish a connection with the other person.Although this research overwhelmingly involves human subjects, some findings that demonstrate bias have been found in non-human animals as well. For example, loss aversion has been shown in monkeys and hyperbolic discounting has been observed in rats, pigeons, and monkeys.},

  abstract = {Civic media literacy entails understanding complex topics and events that are increasingly mediated by digital sources of information and where it can be challenging to evaluate the reliability merits of these sources. The goal of this study was to discern the ways undergraduate preservice social studies teachers with different climate change beliefs read and evaluated the reliability of four diverse Web sources about the complex socioscientific topic of climate change. Findings highlight clear alignment between most participants with climate change beliefs at either end of a beliefs continuum with less alignment for participants with climate change beliefs toward the middle of a continuum. Findings also point to the benefits of whole group deliberation to help participants more critically evaluate a Web source that opposed the scientific consensus about climate change. In an age of “alternative facts,” this study points to the importance of students and educators having opportunities to evaluate, discuss, and determine the credibility of a range of online sources.},

  abstract = {Background.{$\quad$} On 7 February 2020, French Health authorities were informed of a confirmed case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in an Englishman infected in Singapore who had recently stayed in a chalet in the French Alps. We conducted an investigation to identify secondary cases and interrupt transmission. Methods.{$\quad$} We defined as a confirmed case a person linked to the chalet with a positive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction sample for SARS-CoV-2. Results.{$\quad$} The index case stayed 4 days in the chalet with 10 English tourists and a family of 5 French residents; SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 5 individuals in France, 6 in England (including the index case), and 1 in Spain (overall attack rate in the chalet: 75\%). One pediatric case, with picornavirus and influenza A coinfection, visited 3 different schools while symptomatic. One case was asymptomatic, with similar viral load as that of a symptomatic case. Seven days after the first cases were diagnosed, 1 tertiary case was detected in a symptomatic patient with from the chalet a positive endotracheal aspirate; all previous and concurrent nasopharyngeal specimens were negative. Additionally, 172 contacts were monitored; all contacts tested for SARS-CoV-2 (N = 73) were negative. Conclusions.{$\quad$} The occurrence in this cluster of 1 asymptomatic case with similar viral load as a symptomatic patient suggests transmission potential of asymptomatic individuals. The fact that an infected child did not transmit the disease despite close interactions within schools suggests potential different transmission dynamics in children. Finally, the dissociation between upper and lower respiratory tract results underscores the need for close monitoring of the clinical evolution of suspected cases of coronavirus disease 2019.},

Il s’agira ici de s’interroger sur le lien entre « connaissance », « adhésion » et « transmission » dans les théories du complot et les rumeurs à travers deux études empiriques. Peut-on connaître et transmettre sans adhérer ? Peut-on connaître et adhérer sans transmettre ? Peut-on adhérer et transmettre sans réellement « connaître » ?, Conspiracy theories and rumors, as forms manifesting “social thought” (Rouquette, 1973), share processes and functions. The few studies dealing specifically with the question of belief in rumors questioned the link between adhesion and transmission (Allport \& Lepkin 1943; Rosnow, 1991; Guerin \& Miyazaki, 2006). The aim here will be to question the link between « knowledge », « adhesion » and « transmission » in conspiracy theories and rumors through two empirical studies. Can we know and transmit without adhering to? Can one know and adhere to without transmitting? Can we adhere to and transmit without actually « knowing »?},

  abstract = {L'année 2016 a été consacrée comme celle de la « post-vérité ». Que faut-il comprendre par ce terme ? Selon le dictionnaire d'Oxford, qui en a fait son mot de l'année, le terme désignerait des « circonstances dans lesquelles les faits objectifs ont moins d'influence pour former l'opinion publique que l'appel à l'émotion et aux croyances personnelles ». Ce livre prend le parti de retourner à la source de cet état des lieux et l'identifie dans le concept de « bullshit » théorisé par le philosophe Harry Frankfurt en 1986. Ce qu'il a défini comme une « indifférence à l'égard de la vérité » distincte du mensonge s'avère en effet un outil conceptuel remarquablement efficace pour saisir comment l'opinion prétend l'emporter sur la vérité et pour comprendre le succès des impostures scientifiques et des « théories du complot ». L'ère de la~post-vérité est bien celle du bullshit institué à une échelle globale, et seule une compréhension fine de ce phénomène permettra d'engager la lutte qui se prépare. Heureusement, une telle science du bullshit est en fait déjà disponible, mais il restait à l'assembler en un seul volume accessible, utile et stimulant.},

Individuals’ cyber-safety is also critical for national cybersecurity. The issue is highly relevant for Israel, a country that relies on the digital capabilities of its workers for its major technology industries and is also often a target of cyberwarfare and cybercrime attacks. The purpose of this study is to identify the determinants of cyber-safety behavior. We investigate the role of age, gender and education in the use of safety-related digital skills and antivirus software. Using a 2014 survey of a national sample of Internet users in Israel (N = 1850), we found that age, gender, education and quality of access are associated with the level of users’ digital security skills. In addition, these skills and the frequency of conducting financial activities online are the main determinants of antivirus behaviors. Our results expand the understanding of cyber-safety by showing that social and digital disparities are reproduced in the use of measures to prevent online threats, putting the digitally disadvantaged at greater risk of becoming victims of online threats.},

  abstract = {Background According to epidemiological studies, Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with probable REM sleep behavior disorder (pRBD) are more prone to develop impulse control disorders (ICDs), which is shown to be present in drug-naïve PD patients, and vice versa. Objectives To investigate white-matter integrity differences, with and without comorbid pRBD and ICDs. Methods 149 de-novo PD patients and 30 age- and gender-matched controls from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative were studied. PD subjects were categorized into four groups with and without these comorbidities. We investigated the white matter integrity differences between these groups. Results PDs with only ICDs manifested greater fractional anisotropy (FA) and lower mean diffusivity (MD) in ipsilateral cerebellar connections when compared to controls and to Parkinson's with both comorbid disorders. In contrast, significantly lower FA and higher MD in the ipsilateral fornix-stria-terminalis was observed in PDs with only pRBD compared to controls and to PDs without either comorbid disorder. Also, PDs with only pRBD manifested greater FA in contralateral putamen when compared to controls. Conclusions Our results suggest the presence of an underlying neural network in PDs with ICDs, particularly involving cerebellar connections, which makes the subjects susceptible to pRBD. Lower white-matter integrity in the fornix of PDs with only pRBD suggests a neuropathological pathway specific to sleep behavior disorder, independent of impulse control disorders. Greater white-matter integrity observed in PDs without comorbid ICDs, regardless of their comorbid pRBD status, might reflect compensatory mechanisms. Targeted therapies for this particular neuropathology may help prevent these comorbidities.},

  abstract = {Probiotic treatment has been gaining attention due to its remarkable effects in alleviating toxicity and carcinogenesis. The novel strain Pediococcus pentosaceus GS4 has been reported for probiotic, survivability in simulated gastrointestinal fluid, and antioxidative and biohydrogenation properties. Therefore, we hypothesize that this specific strain might be able to assuage the effect of azoxymethane (AOM)-induced toxicity in mice. Twenty-eight Swiss albino mice were divided into 4 groups and were studied for-32 weeks. Azoxymethane (10 mg/kg body weight) was administered intraperitoneally twice (Oth and 14th days), and probiotic GS4 (1.1 x 10(9) colony-forming unit/mL) was given orally for the respective groups. Mice who served as the normal control received only normal saline. GS4-intervened AOM-induced mice showed marked improvement at the histopathologic level, in the liver and kidney. Moreover, probiotic GS4 intervention in AOM-induced mice exhibited a significant reduction in the liver function biomarker when compared with the AOM-induced mice. Probiotic GS4 intervention reduced the intestinal structural deformities as evident from the elevated brush border membrane-associated disaccharidases (sucrase, lactase) and intestinal alkaline phosphatase activities, which were found disrupted by AOM intoxication. Fecal bacterial load was found to be reduced in AOM-induced mice which were subsequently replenished by the probiotic GS4 intervention as apparent from the enhanced fecal bacterial load. There were no adverse effects observed in the probiotic control group. Conclusively, novel probiotic strain GS4 exhibited safe and beneficial effects against the toxicity threats posed by AOM. Thus, GS4 could be considered as a potential food supplement/additive for therapeutic purposes in gastrointestinal disorders related to inflammation and cancer. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Five recent reviews have analyzed trials on the association between artificial food colors and ADHD; the 50 underlying studies and the reviews in aggregate were inconclusive. Recent work has shown human in vivo SULT1A inhibition leading to incremental catecholamines, and an inverted-U relationship between brain catecholamines and proper functioning of the prefrontal cortex where ADHD behavior can arise. METHOD: This study re-examined the same underlying trials for evidence that SULT1A inhibitors were in the placebos and other inactive foods, that these "inactive" materials were symptomatic, and that ADHD symptoms exhibited an inverted-U response to SULT1A inhibition. RESULTS: Nearly all the underlying diets, and many placebos and delivery vehicles, were found to contain SULT1A inhibitors. Eight publications provided evidence of ADHD symptoms caused by the "inactive" materials containing SULT1A inhibitors. Ten studies showed additional SULT1A inhibitors reducing the symptoms of some subjects. CONCLUSION: SULT1A inhibitors in foods, including natural substances and artificial food colors, have a role in ADHD that can both worsen or improve symptoms. Mechanistically, SULT1A enzymes normally deactivate catecholamines, especially dopamine formed in the intestines; SULT1A inhibition can influence brain catecholamines through the intermediary of plasma tyrosine levels, which are influenced by dopamine inhibition of intestinal tyrosine hydroxylase. Biochemical measurements focused on SULT1A activity and plasma tyrosine concentrations are proposed for future work.},

A wealth of data pointed out that various aspects of chronic inflammation may be affected by several specific dietary factors. This paper calls attention to anthocyanins enriched plant food and anthocyanin dietary supplements, whose role in the management of IBD and its associated oncogenesis deems crucial. Area covered: We updated the most relevant dietary anthocyanins with potential anti-colitis and preventive effect on inflammatory associated colorectal cancer based on the recent animal and human researches along with revealing the major cellular and molecular mechanisms of action. Mounting evidence reported that anthocyanins enriched plant foods perform their protective role on IBD and inflammatory-induced colorectal cancer via different cellular transduction signaling pathways, including inflammatory transcription factors, SAPK/JNK and p38 MAPK cascade, JAK/STAT signaling, NF-kB/pERK/MAPK, Wnt signaling pathway, Nrf2 cytoprotective pathway as well as AMPK pathway and autophagy. Expert commentary: Combination of anthocyanins enriched dietary supplements with existing medications can provide new therapeutic options for IBD patients. Further, well-designed randomized control trials (RCTs) are essential to evaluate the role of anthocyanins enriched medicinal foods as well as isolated anthocyanin components as promising preventive and therapeutic dietary agents for IBD and its associated oncogenesis.},

  abstract = {Impaired visual search is a hallmark of spatial neglect. When searching for an unique feature (e.g., color) neglect patients often show only slight visual field asymmetries. In contrast, when the target is defined by a combination of features (e.g., color and form) they exhibit a severe deficit of contralesional search. This finding suggests a selective impairment of the serial deployment of spatial attention. Here, we examined this deficit with a preview paradigm. Neglect patients searched for a target defined by the conjunction of shape and color, presented together with varying numbers of distracters. The presentation time was varied such that on some trials participants previewed the target together with same-shape/different-color distracters, for 300 or 600 ms prior to the appearance of additional different-shape/same-color distracters. On the remaining trials the target and all distracters were shown simultaneously. Healthy participants exhibited a serial search strategy only when all items were presented simultaneously, whereas in both preview conditions a pop-out effect was observed. Neglect patients showed a similar pattern when the target was presented in the right hemifield. In contrast, when searching for a target in the left hemifield they showed serial search in the no-preview condition, as well as with a preview of 300 ms, and partly even at 600 ms. A control experiment suggested that the failure to fully benefit from item preview was probably independent of accurate perception of time. Our results, when viewed in the context of existing literature, lead us to conclude that the visual search deficit in neglect reflects two additive factors: a biased representation of attentional priority in favor of ipsilesional information and exaggerated capture of attention by ipsilesional abrupt onsets.},

  abstract = {Can multiculturalism work? Can people from different religious and ethnic backgrounds live side by side peacefully and, even better, enrich each other? There are two ways social scientists can deal with this question. The first one, which I would label as “macro”, focuses on statistics and opinion surveys. A macro approach would, for instance, analyze the effects of an increase in religious and ethnic diversity on social indicators such as trust in neighbors, civic engagement or political participation. The second one, which I would label as “micro”, focuses on the skills citizens need for a better management of cultural diversity. This paper falls into the second category and will provide support for two claims: (1) training for intercultural communication should focus first and foremost on empathy; (2) ancient rhetorical exercises offer an effective way to develop empathy. To support the first claim, it will be argued that for a multicultural society to be peaceful, citizens need to be willing and able to use empathy when interacting with their fellow citizens of different religious, ethnic or ideological background (section I). A method to develop empathy using rhetorical exercises will then be described (section II). Finally, I present the results of an experiment to test its effectiveness with secondary school teachers (section III).},

  abstract = {Can multiculturalism work? Can people from different religious and ethnic backgrounds live side by side peacefully and, even better, enrich each other? There are two ways social scientists can deal with this question. The first one, which I would label as “macro”, focuses on statistics and opinion surveys. A macro approach would, for instance, analyze the effects of an increase in religious and ethnic diversity on social indicators such as trust in neighbors, civic engagement or political participation. The second one, which I would label as “micro”, focuses on the skills citizens need for a better management of cultural diversity. This paper falls into the second category and will provide support for two claims: (1) training for intercultural communication should focus first and foremost on empathy; (2) ancient rhetorical exercises offer an effective way to develop empathy.~To support the first claim, it will be argued that for a multicultural society to be peaceful, citizens need to be willing and able to use empathy when interacting with their fellow citizens of different religious, ethnic or ideological background (section I). A method to develop empathy using rhetorical exercises will then be described (section II). Finally, I present the results of an experiment to test its effectiveness with secondary school teachers (section III).},

Son culte a pour principe divin le Marché, dont l’appétit n’est apaisé que par la croissance. Il a pour valeur cardinale la liberté d’entreprendre, pour idéal l’équilibre et pour credo l’infinitude du monde, condition à la satisfaction des dieux. Il a ses temples, ces Bourses où valsent les indices, reflets des humeurs divines. Il a ses rites de consommation ; il a son clergé – la finance – et ses archiprêtres – les banquiers centraux, seuls capables d’apaiser la colère des dieux. L’économie a acquis l’autorité dont était investie la religion.

The author will show that CRT scores are predictive of the types of choices that feature prominently in tests of decision-making theories, like expected utility theory and prospect theory. Indeed, the relation is sometimes so strong that the preferences themselves effectively function as expressions of cognitive ability—an empirical fact begging for a theoretical explanation. The author examines the relation between CRT scores and two important decision-making characteristics: time preference and risk preference. The CRT scores are then compared with other measures of cognitive ability or cognitive "style." The CRT scores exhibit considerable difference between men and women and the article explores how this relates to sex differences in time and risk preferences. The final section addresses the interpretation of correlations between cognitive abilities and decision-making characteristics.},

Killing depends on T cell recognition of antigens presented by class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I) proteins on tumor cells. In this study, we showed that medulloblastomas lacking the p53 tumor suppressor do not express surface MHC-I and are therefore resistant to immune rejection. Mechanistically, this is because p53 regulates expression of the peptide transporter Tap1 and the aminopeptidase Erap1, which are required for MHC-I trafficking to the cell surface. In vitro, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or lymphotoxin-β receptor agonist can rescue expression of Erap1, Tap1 and MHC-I on p53-mutant tumor cells. In vivo, low doses of TNF prolong survival and synergize with immune checkpoint inhibitors to promote tumor rejection. These studies identified p53 as a key regulator of immune evasion and suggest that TNF could be used to enhance sensitivity of tumors to immunotherapy.},

On the other hand, information literacy (IL) is about learning how to seek, use and communicate the information. The articles' analysis has identified few ones related to such theme, indicating the need for more investments in this research area, while recognizing metacognition's potential to enhance information literacy learning. The report suggests metacognitive strategies for teaching patterns of information literacy. The metacognitive strategies are based on three functions – planning, monitoring, and evaluation. The learners need to develop the capacity to reflect on their own processes of seeking and using the information – IL –, as well as to know and understand what, when, how and why they perform activities related to seeking and using information, and to the use of intervention strategies.},

Dans cet ouvrage à la fois théorique et pratique, philosophes et chercheurs exposent les failles mentales qui rendent vulnérables aux erreurs de raisonnement, tandis que vidéastes, journalistes ou enseignants témoignent des actions menées pour développer l'hygiène mentale de leurs contemporains. Ensemble, ils imaginent les bonnes pratiques de l'autodéfense intellectuelle, afin de poser les jalons d'un enseignement de l'esprit critique plus que jamais nécessaire et qui, surtout, aura fait la preuve de son efficience (4e de couverture)},

  abstract = {Background: The purpose of this research was to study the effectiveness of the overall dietary intervention rather than a single nutrient on children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Methods: This is a randomized controlled trial conducted at a child psychiatry clinic in Iran. Participants were 106 children and adolescents with ADHD. One group received methylphenidate plus dietary recommendations, while the other group only received methylphenidate. ADHD DSM-IV checklist was used to assess inattentiveness and hyperactivity/impulsivity scores at baseline and at the end of the trial. Results: The results revealed no significant difference between the two groups regarding mean age, gender ratio, body mass index, baseline inattentiveness score, and baseline hyperactivity score. Linear regression analysis considering the covariant variables showed that the inattentive score at the end of the trial was significantly associated with the mean change of favorite diet scores. Conclusion: This is the first clinical trial examining the effect of overall dietary characteristics rather than a single nutrient on the children formally diagnosed with ADHD. According to the results, un-favorite diet had no effects on inattentive or hyperactivity/impulsivity score. Encouraging the children with ADHD to increase their intake of recommended diet markedly improves their attention.},

Using Hardin’s Tragedy of the Commons, we show that an improper opening and enlargement of the digital environment (Infosphere) is likely to produce a Tragedy of the Digital Commons (TDC). In the course of the analysis, we explain why Adar and Huberman’s previous use of Hardin’s Tragedy to interpret certain recent phenomena in the Infosphere (especially peer-to-peer communication) may not be entirely satisfactory. We then seek to provide an improved version of the TDC that avoids the possible shortcomings of their model. Next, we analyse some problems encountered by the application of classical ethics in the resolution of the TDC. In the conclusion, we outline the kind of work that will be required to develop an ethical approach that may bridge the digital divide but avoid the TDC.},

  abstract = {Objective To describe and discuss the process used to write a narrative review of the literature for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Publication of narrative overviews of the literature should be standardized to increase their objectivity. Background In the past decade numerous changes in research methodology pertaining to reviews of the literature have occurred. These changes necessitate authors of review articles to be familiar with current standards in the publication process. Methods Narrative overview of the literature synthesizing the findings of literature retrieved from searches of computerized databases, hand searches, and authoritative texts. Discussion An overview of the use of three types of reviews of the literature is presented. Step by step instructions for how to conduct and write a narrative overview utilizing a ‘best-evidence synthesis’ approach are discussed, starting with appropriate preparatory work and ending with how to create proper illustrations. Several resources for creating reviews of the literature are presented and a narrative overview critical appraisal worksheet is included. A bibliography of other useful reading is presented in an appendix. Conclusion Narrative overviews can be a valuable contribution to the literature if prepared properly. New and experienced authors wishing to write a narrative overview should find this article useful in constructing such a paper and carrying out the research process. It is hoped that this article will stimulate scholarly dialog amongst colleagues about this research design and other complex literature review methods.},

Such mice are 3 fold more active compared to their control littermates. Genetic association studies support a role for allelic variants of the human SNAP25 gene in predisposing to ADHD. Methods/Principal Findings: We performed association analysis across the SNAP25 gene in 1,107 individuals (339 ADHD trios). To assess the functional relevance of the SNAP25-ADHD associated allele, we performed quantitative PCR on postmortem tissue derived from the inferior frontal gyrus of 89 unaffected adults. Significant associations with the A allele of SNP rs362990 (chi(2) = 10, p-corrected = 0.019, OR = 1.5) and three marker haplotypes (rs6108461, rs362990 and rs362998) were observed. Furthermore, a significant additive decrease in the expression of the SNAP25 transcript as a function of the risk allele was also observed. This effect was detected at the haplotype level, where increasing copies of the ADHD-associated haplotype reduced the expression of the transcript. Conclusions: Our data show that DNA variation at SNAP25 confers risk to ADHD and reduces the expression of the transcript in a region of the brain that is critical for the regulation of attention and inhibition.},

Mais le monde académique que nous dessinent les nouveaux chantres de l'identitarisme communautarisme n'a rien à envier à celui que s'étaient jadis annexé les grandes idéologies. Nos "universitaires engagés", trouvant sans doute que voter, manifester, militer dans une association ou un parti ne sont pas assez chics pour eux, tentent de reconquérir les amphithéâtres et leurs annexes.

Notre analyse repose sur une étude comparative et transnationale de l’évaluation des biotechnologies, avec une focale sur les risques liés au clonage animal, en Europe et aux États-Unis. Quelles sont les connaissances produites en relation à un cadre réglementaire et institutionnel qu’elles contribuent à construire ? Nous identifions deux modes de production différenciés d’expertise scientifique dans lesquels la science réglementaire est plus ou moins centrale et qui associent différentes façons de produire de la connaissance (formes de raisonnement, traitement de l’incertitude, hiérarchie des sources de connaissance) et différentes façons de réguler les activités (architectures institutionnelles, ressources réglementaires, sources d’autorité). La production d’expertise s’avère donc prise dans l’ensemble des règles que forme cette « science réglementaire » qui, portant la marque des histoires nationales, entrave fortement les efforts d’harmonisation.},

Prevailing expectations posit that literacy interventions help audiences to be “inoculated” against any harmful effects of misleading information. This study empirically investigates such assumptions by assessing whether individuals with greater literacy (media, information, news, and digital literacies) are better at recognizing fake news, and which of these literacies are most relevant. The results reveal that information literacy—but not other literacies—significantly increases the likelihood of identifying fake news stories. Interpreting the results, we provide both conceptual and methodological explanations. Particularly, we raise questions about the self-reported competencies that are commonly used in literacy scales.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}As children are under-represented in current studies aiming to analyse transmission of SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), their contribution to transmission is unclear. Viral load, as measured by RT-PCR, can inform considerations regarding transmission, especially if existing knowledge of viral load in other respiratory diseases is taken into account. RT-PCR threshold cycle data from 3303 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (out of 77,996 persons tested in total, drawn from across Germany) were analysed to examine the relationship between patient age and estimated viral load. Two PCR systems were used. In data from the PCR system predominantly used for community and cluster screening during the early phase of the epidemic (Roche LightCycler 480 II), when such screening was frequent practice, viral loads do not differ significantly in three comparisons between young and old age groups (differences in log\textsubscript{10} viral loads between young and old estimated from raw viral load data and a Bayesian mixture model of gamma distributions collectively range between −0.11 and −0.43). Data from a second type of PCR system (Roche cobas 6800/8800), introduced into diagnostic testing on March 16, 2020 and used during the time when household and other contact testing was reduced, show a credible but small difference in the three comparisons between young and old age groups (differences, measured as above, collectively range between −0.43 and −0.83). This small difference may be due to differential patterns of PCR instrument utilization rather than to an actual difference in viral load. Considering household transmission data on influenza, which has a similar viral load kinetic to SARS-CoV-2, the viral load differences between age groups observed in this study are likely to be of limited relevance. Combined data from both PCR instruments show that viral loads of at least 250,000 copies, a threshold we previously established for the isolation of infectious virus in cell culture at more than 5\% probability, were present across the study period in 29.0\% of kindergarten-aged patients 0-6 years old (n=38), 37.3\% of those aged 0-19 (n=150), and in 51.4\% of those aged 20 and above (n=3153). The differences in these fractions may also be due to differences in test utilization. We conclude that a considerable percentage of infected people in all age groups, including those who are pre- or mild-symptomatic, carry viral loads likely to represent infectivity. Based on these results and uncertainty about the remaining incidence, we recommend caution and careful monitoring during gradual lifting of non-pharmaceutical interventions. In particular, there is little evidence from the present study to support suggestions that children may not be as infectious as adults.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In an experiment embedded within a nationally representative survey of youth ages 15 to 27 (N = 2,101), youth were asked to judge the accuracy of one of several simulated online posts. Consistent with research on motivated reasoning, youth assessments depended on (a) the alignment of the claim with one’s prior policy position and to a lesser extent on (b) whether the post included an inaccurate statement. To consider ways educators might improve judgments of accuracy, we also investigated the influence of political knowledge and exposure to media literacy education. We found that political knowledge did not improve judgments of accuracy but that media literacy education did.},

Symptoms of ADHD include hyperactivity, low frustration tolerance, impulsivity, and inattention. While the biological pathways leading to ADHD are not clearly delineated, a number of genetic and environmental risk factors for the disorder are recognized. In the early 1970s, research conducted by Dr. Benjamin Feingold found that when hyperactive children were given a diet free of artificial food additives and dyes, symptoms of hyperactivity were reduced. While some clinical studies supported these findings, more rigorous empirical studies conducted over the next 20 years were less positive. As a result, research on the role of food additives in contributing to ADHD waned. In recent years, however, interest in this area has revived. In response to more recent research and public petitions, in December 2009 the British government requested that food manufacturers remove most artificial food dyes from their products. While these strictures could have positive effects on behavior, the removal of food dyes is not a panacea for ADHD, which is a multifaceted disorder with both biological and environmental underpinnings.},

While existing studies have attended to Islam’s engagement with capitalism, less attention has been given to the ideological intimacy of this relationship and, in particular, the increasing presence of radical free market thought in global Islamist politics, or what I have termed ‘libertarian Islamism’. The dominant narrative of Islamism, thus, constricts our understanding of the wider ideological ecology at play in the global political mobilization of Islam. While political Islam is often regarded as being rooted in a broadly leftist intellectual milieu, it has rather encapsulated variant conceptions of liberty, both left and right, and is currently undergoing what one might term a ‘free-market turn’. Within this milieu, a distinctly radical, anti-statist libertarian ideology has also emerged with an intimate relationship to conservative libertarian activists in the West. The presence of libertarian Islamism serves to recalibrate dominant understandings of ‘radical’ Islam and its purportedly fractious ideological relationship with the West.},

Roi du storytelling, Adrián est l'un de ces spin doctors chargés de produire la lumière qui illuminera le meilleur profil d'un candidat, en fera un produit désirable pour les électeurs. Menteur par vocation, par profession et par nécessité conjugale, il est l'heureux détenteur d'une double vie, entre son épouse et ses deux enfants à Vitoria, et sa maîtresse torride à Madrid. Pour l'heure, sa mission est de faire entrer dans le grand bain national le jeune élu local Javier Morodo, dont l'homosexualité assumée offrira un gaywashing au Parti, trop longtemps accusé d'homophobie. Tâche élémentaire pour Adrián, que vient compliquer la découverte inopinée de trois têtes coupées de conseillers municipaux artistement conservées dans des bonbonnes en cristal. Qui est derrière ces meurtres baroques ? Quel lien les rattache à une opération autour des palais en ruine qui constellent la cité basque ? Soudain, la vie d'Adrián l'imposteur se détraque, menaçant de faire mentir sa devise, selon laquelle "le menteur est un dieu dont le verbe crée des mondes".

  abstract = {Objectives: Removing artificial food coloring (AFC) is a common dietary intervention for children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), but has not been tested in young adults. This pilot study examined the effects of AFC on ADHD symptoms and electroencephalography (EEG) in college students with and without ADHD. Methods: At baseline, control and ADHD participants completed the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS), simple and complex attention measures, and resting-state EEG recordings. ADHD participants (n = 18) and a subset of controls (extended control group or EC, n = 11) avoided AFC in their diet for 2 weeks and then were randomized to a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover challenge. Subjects received either 225 mg AFC disguised in chocolate cookies or placebo chocolate cookies for 3 days each week, with testing on the third day each week. Baseline comparisons were made using Student's t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum tests and challenge period analyses were run using General Linear Modeling. Results: The ADHD group had significantly greater scores on the ASRS (p {$<$} 0.001), confirming a symptom differential between groups; however, there were no differences in attentional measures or EEG at baseline. The AFC challenge resulted in an increase in posterior mean gamma power (p = 0.05), a decrease in posterior relative alpha power (p = 0.04), and a marginal increase in inattentive symptoms (p = 0.08) in the ADHD group. There were no effects of AFC in the EC group. Discussion: This study indicates that AFC exposure may affect brainwave activity and ADHD symptoms in college students with ADHD. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.},

These contributions come at a considerable cost: U.S. academic libraries paid \$1.7 billion for serial subscriptions in 2008 alone. Library budgets, in contrast, are flat and not able to keep pace with serial price inflation. We have investigated the publishers' value proposition by conducting a comparative study of pre-print papers and their final published counterparts. This comparison had two working assumptions: 1) if the publishers' argument is valid, the text of a pre-print paper should vary measurably from its corresponding final published version, and 2) by applying standard similarity measures, we should be able to detect and quantify such differences. Our analysis revealed that the text contents of the scientific papers generally changed very little from their pre-print to final published versions. These findings contribute empirical indicators to discussions of the added value of commercial publishers and therefore should influence libraries' economic decisions regarding access to scholarly publications.},

These decisions provide an interesting case study of the role of scientific evidence in the assessment of food additives and risk to children's health and formulation of food policy. Although there continues to be uncertainty concerning the link between AFCs and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), policy decisions have been made that have far-reaching implications. In addition, publicity surrounding the policy changes may shape public perceptions concerning effective management of ADHD. We believe that the balance of existing evidence neither refutes nor supports the link between AFCs and ADHD, which highlights the need for carefully designed studies to further investigate the link between AFCs and ADHD. In this article we describe a model for such studies. In developing our model, we drew from current investigative standards in ADHD research, such as those used in the landmark Multimodal Treatment Study of Children With ADHD. These standards encompass methodologic considerations including sample selection, outcome assessment, and data analyses. It is our hope that this model research methodology may prove valuable in addressing design considerations in future studies of AFCs and ADHD with the goal of producing reliable data that will enable policy-makers to better formulate effective, evidence-based food-policy decisions.},

En entrant dans l'ère de l'Anthropocène, nous avons perdu le contrôle de notre monde. La science de l'effondrement, ou collapsologie, affirme que la catastrophe est inévitable et qu'il ne nous reste plus qu'à nous y préparer. Il nous faut accepter la chute, que l'on s'en désespère ou que l'on y trouve une jouissance coupable. Autrement dit, "il n'y a pas d'alternative" - comme le disait en son temps Margaret Thatcher. Or il y a une alternative. Il y en a même de très nombreuses, car ailleurs la catastrophe est déjà arrivée et a déjà donné naissance à des mobilisations politiques et écologiques. Le catastrophisme, cette construction récente qui touche les classes moyennes occidentales, c'est un "récit du Tout ", un récit dépolitisé qui nous encourage à nous prendre en charge de manière privée. Or, c'est en politisant l'écologie et en adoptant un point de vue local que nous verrons se rouvrir les possibilités d'action, dans leur : pluralité. C'est ainsi que nous éviterons la catastrophe - car elle est évitable." (4e de couverture)},

  abstract = {Over the past half century, two overarching questions have dominated the study of mass political behavior: How do ordinary citizens form their political judgments, and how good are those judgments from a normative perspective? The authors of The Ambivalent Partisan offer a novel approach to these questions, one in which political reasoning is viewed as arising from trade-offs among three generally conflicting psychological goals: making decisions easily, getting them right, and maintaining cognitive consistency. Taking aim at decades of received wisdom, the central claim of this book is that high-quality political judgment hinges less on citizens' cognitive ability than on their willingness to temporarily suspend partisan habits and follow the "evidence" wherever it leads. This occurs most readily when citizens experience a disjuncture between their stable political identities and their contemporary evaluations of party performance, a state the authors refer to as partisan ambivalence. Drawing on both experimental and survey methods -- as well as five decades of American political history -- the authors demonstrate that compared to other citizens, ambivalent partisans perceive the political world accurately, form their policy preferences in a principled manner, and communicate those preferences by making issues an important component of their electoral decisions. The book's most important conclusion is that a non-trivial portion of the electorate manages to escape the vicissitudes of apathy or wanton bias, and it is these citizens -- these ambivalent partisans -- who reliably approximate a desirable standard of democratic citizenship.},

  abstract = {"En travail. Conversations sur le communisme" : c'est le titre du livre récemment publié par Bernard Friot et Frédéric Lordon aux éditions La Dispute, fruit d'échanges entre ces deux figures de la pensée de gauche organisés au printemps dernier par Amélie Jeammet.  Avec Julien Théry, qui les reçoit pour Le Média, les deux auteurs reviennent sur leurs points d'accord, qui portent sur l'essentiel : le communisme réel ne peut se développer ni en fuyant l'économie, les institutions et toute et la sphère de la production capitaliste dans des dissidences, ni en s'en remettant à un futur mythique et messianique. Bernard Friot s’intéresse à la poursuite de la construction d’institutions alternatives au capitalisme : salaire à vie, propriété d’usage, souveraineté sur l’investissement. Frédéric Lordon développe une philosophie spinoziste des institutions, après avoir, comme économiste, analysé le capitalisme financiarisé. Leurs trajectoires scientifiques et militantes sensiblement différentes n’en convergent pas moins sur la nécessité d’une proposition communiste qui donnerait à une mobilisation générale l’appui de figures et de réalisations concrètes. Il fallait une authentique rencontre intellectuelle, avec ce qu’elle suppose de confrontation fraternelle des idées, pour aboutir ainsi à cette mise en travail du communisme. ▶ Ni actionnaire, ni publicité, Le Média TV est indépendant et ne vit que de vos dons :  👉 https://www.lemediatv.fr/soutien ▶ Soutenez Le Média :  👉 https://www.lemediatv.fr/soutien 👉 https://www.okpal.com/le-media/ 👉 https://fr.tipeee.com/le-media ✅  Suivez-nous :  Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/lemedia\_tv/ Facebook : http://bit.ly/FacebookLeMedia Twitter : http://bit.ly/TwitterLeMedia Youtube : http://bit.ly/YouTubeLeMedia Peertube : https://video.lemediatv.fr Telegram :  https://t.me/LeMediaOfficiel Rejoignez la communauté des Socios !},

At times, it is used as a guide for organizing lessons, at other times it is used with the intention of summarizing essential curricular content. The way in which PowerPoint is used and the form it takes differs between faculties. The present article aims to evaluate the impact of the provision of slides on student academic performance and attendance (regardless of test scores). For this purpose, a quasi-experimental study was carried out with two intrasubject manipulated learning situations in which copies of slides created by teachers were, or were not, made available to students prior to class sessions. Additionally, student academic engagement and study strategies were assessed using two scales in order to analyse whether these variables modified the relationship between access to slides and academic performance. Outcomes revealed that access to slides developed by teachers had a negative impact on student performance and attendance to classes. Student academic engagement and study strategies were found to modify the relationship between academic performance and access to slides.},

  abstract = {In order to improve appetite, attract consumers and even conform to the food culture, food coloring has become one of the necessary links in modern food processing. For example, dried-tofu will be colored by adding artificial food colors (AFCs) such as sunset yellow, cochineal red A or other seasonings like soy sauce. However, the dispute persists about whether AFCs are harmful to health. Some studies indicate AFCs affect children's intelligence and attention, cause hyperactivity, and allergy when children consumed {$>$}= 50 mg. In addition, researches showed that chemical soy sauce produces a trace of methylglyoxal (MGO) in the manufacturing process, which is related to diseases such as oxidative stress, diabetes, and cognitive deterioration. Therefore, natural pigments are relatively new and promising strategy for replacing high-risk AFCs. Thus, the objective of this study was to use dried-tofu as a natural colorants coloring screening platform, through the concept of three primary colors to discuss the coloring effects of natural colorants in Taiwan in double-phase (liquid phase to solid phase) food coloring system and assess the effects of MGO on PC12 neuron cellular morphology and cell cycle at the dietary exposure in soy sauce. Our results showed that formula G:R = 0.2:0.8 and C:R = 0.08:0.92 were coloring by combined natural colorants had the same eye sensory quality acceptance of consumer and had the intention to purchase. Furthermore, the results from the PC12 cell suggested that dietary exposure of methylglyoxal ({$<$}50 mu M) in soy sauce did not affect neuron cellular morphology and cell cycle significantly. Overall, Gardenia Yellow, Curcumin, and Radish Red could overcome the application restrictions in multiple-phase food coloring system and simultaneously soy sauce as a coloring agent was safety. It showed the possibility of them as food colorants on dried-tofu. (C) 2018 "Society information". Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Cognitive biases are systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment, and are often studied in psychology and behavioral economics. Although the reality of most of these biases is confirmed by reproducible research, there are often controversies about how to classify these biases or how to explain them. Some are effects of information-processing rules (i.e., mental shortcuts), called heuristics, that the brain uses to produce decisions or judgments. Biases have a variety of forms and appear as cognitive ("cold") bias, such as mental noise, or motivational ("hot") bias, such as when beliefs are distorted by wishful thinking. Both effects can be present at the same time.There are also controversies over some of these biases as to whether they count as useless or irrational, or whether they result in useful attitudes or behavior. For example, when getting to know others, people tend to ask leading questions which seem biased towards confirming their assumptions about the person. However, this kind of confirmation bias has also been argued to be an example of social skill: a way to establish a connection with the other person.Although this research overwhelmingly involves human subjects, some findings that demonstrate bias have been found in non-human animals as well. For example, loss aversion has been shown in monkeys and hyperbolic discounting has been observed in rats, pigeons, and monkeys.},

  abstract = {The communication and regulation of risk has changed significantly over the past 30 years in Europe and to a noticeable but lesser extent in the United States. In Europe, this is partly due to a series of regulatory mishaps, ranging from mad cow disease in the United Kingdom to contamination of the blood supply in France. In the United States, general public confidence in the American government has been gradually declining for more than three decades, driven by a mix of cultural and political conflicts like negative political advertising, a corrosive news media, and cuts in regulatory budgets. While the former approach is based on an objective assessment of the risk, the latter is driven more by the perception of the risk, consumer sentiment, political will, and sectoral advocacy. In this article, the author examines three U.S.-based food case studies (acrylamide, bisphenol A, and artificial food colorings) where regulations at the local and state levels are increasingly being based on perceived risk advocacy rather than on the most effective response to the risk, be it to food safety or public health, as defined by regulatory interpretation of existing data. In the final section, the author puts forward a series of recommendations for how U.S.-based regulators can best handle those situations where the perceived risk is markedly different from the fact-based risk, such as strengthening the communication departments of food regulatory agencies, training officials in risk communication, and working more proactively with neutral third-party experts.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To test the individual effect of artificial food colorings (AFCs) and a preservative on the behavior of the general Chinese population. Method: One hundred thirty children (70 boys and 60 girls) in Hong Kong with a mean age of 8.64 years were enlisted to the study with a within-subject crossover between AFCs, a preservative (sodium benzoate), and a placebo capsule. Two behavior scores were used including the strengths and weaknesses of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and normal behavior rating scale and the child behavior checklist-teacher report form. Results: Capsule A containing AFCs and Capsule B containing sodium benzoate had no significant adverse effect compared with placebo in both behavior scores. This result persisted when analysis was restricted to children with 85\% consumption of capsule (per protocol analysis). Conclusion: There seem to be no significant associations between AFCs and a preservative on Chinese children's behavior at the age of 8 to 9 years. Future directions and implications of this research are discussed.},

  abstract = {Communisme ou barbarie, l’alternative est à nouveau sous nos yeux, peut-être même l’est-elle pour la première fois à ce degré d’acuité. Cette fois c’est la planète elle-même qui nous somme. Ou plutôt la planète telle que nous nous la rendons à nous-mêmes inhabitables. Sur ce front-là, on ne tergiverse pas, on ne négocie pas, on n’atermoie pas. Le changement climatique est en marche et, pour la première fois, la Covid-19 nous a fait apercevoir que nous n’aurions pas seulement à en souffrir les canicules, les épisodes météorologiques extrêmes ou les pieds dans l’eau, mais également la libération de virus dont celui qui nous met presque à genoux en ce moment est sans doute l’un des plus «~bénins~».~Posée l’urgence de la situation, c’est l’urgence de penser la situation qui est posée avec elle. Mais peut-être «~penser~» n’est-il pas le mot le plus approprié quand il s’agit de donner le plus de chances à la bonne branche de la bifurcation. «~Imaginer~» pourrait être meilleur. Car la politique, dès lors qu’elle n’a pas pour seule ambition de reconduire l’ordre des choses à l’identique, au moment même où elle fait face à l’obligation impérieuse de faire advenir du radicalement différent, la politique, donc, est affaire d’imagination, au sens littéral du mot~: d’offrir des images. Ou des figures. Aller vers un avenir suppose de s’en être donné des figures.~C’est ce que ce livre s’essaye à faire, à partir d’une position de principes fondamentaux, dont le premier énonce qu’une société communiste a pour devoir de relever les individus de la précarité, de les libérer de l’angoisse des lendemains dans laquelle le marché capitaliste, qui détient toutes les données de leur reproduction matérielle, les plonge inévitablement – et l’effrayante crise sociale qui s’annonce à la suite de la crise sanitaire se chargera d’en donner l’illustration. L’instrument de cette libération s’appelle «~la garantie économique générale~». Elle est directement inspirée des travaux de Bernard Friot sur le «~salaire à vie~». Et se pose très explicitement la question d’un nouveau mode de production, c’est- à-dire des nouveaux rapports sociaux propres à soutenir une division du travail développée en ses multiples échelles~: du local au global.~Sous cette condition, tous les rapports sociaux peuvent être repensés – et en l’occurrence les rapports du capitalisme abolis~: rapport salarial, rapports de propriété privée des moyens de production, rapports financiers. C’est ici qu’aident les figures : à donner des images de ces perspectives constamment renvoyées au registre de «~l’utopie~». Là où les figurations progressent, les disqualifications par l’utopie s’effacent.~Mais ça n’est pas tout d’avoir des figures~: il faut aussi imaginer les trajectoires politiques qui permettent de les rejoindre. Au moins en poser les données fondamentale~: le type de résistance que la bourgeoisie opposera à la disparition de son monde, le type de dynamique politique que cette résistance appellera, le type de bloc social à constituer pour prévaloir, notamment les alliances à passer entre luttes anticapitalistes et luttes antiracistes, enfin la manière dont se redéploie la question internationaliste.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic is an international public health crisis without precedent in the last century. The novelty and rapid spread of the virus have added a new urgency to the availability and distribution of reliable information to help curb its fatal potential. As seasoned and trusted purveyors of reliable public information, librarians have attempted to respond to the “infodemic” of fake news, disinformation, and propaganda with a variety of strategies, but the COVID-19 pandemic presents a unique challenge because of the deadly stakes involved. The seriousness of the current situation requires that librarians and associated professionals re-evaluate the ethical basis of their approach to information provision to counter the growing prominence of conspiracy theories in the public sphere and official decision making. This paper analyzes the conspiracy mindset and specific COVID-19 conspiracy theories in discussing how libraries might address the problems of truth and untruth in ethically sound ways. As a contribution to the re-evaluation we propose, the paper presents an ethical framework based on alethic rights—or rights to truth—as conceived by Italian philosopher Franca D’Agostini and how these might inform professional approaches that support personal safety, open knowledge, and social justice.},

  abstract = {Background One of people’s major motives for going online is the search for health-related information. Most consumers start their search with a general search engine but are unaware of the fact that its sorting and ranking criteria do not mirror information quality. This misconception can lead to distorted search outcomes, especially when the information processing is characterized by heuristic principles and resulting cognitive biases instead of a systematic elaboration. As vaccination opponents are vocal on the Web, the chance of encountering their non‒evidence-based views on immunization is high. Therefore, biased information processing in this context can cause subsequent impaired judgment and decision making. A technological debiasing strategy could counter this by changing people’s search environment. Objective This study aims at testing a technological debiasing strategy to reduce the negative effects of biased information processing when using a general search engine on people’s vaccination-related knowledge and attitudes. This strategy is to manipulate the content of Google’s knowledge graph box, which is integrated in the search interface and provides basic information about the search topic. Methods A full 3x2 factorial, posttest-only design was employed with availability of basic factual information (comprehensible vs hardly comprehensible vs not present) as the first factor and a warning message as the second factor of experimental manipulation. Outcome variables were the evaluation of the knowledge graph box, vaccination-related knowledge, as well as beliefs and attitudes toward vaccination, as represented by three latent variables emerged from an exploratory factor analysis. Results Two-way analysis of variance revealed a significant main effect of availability of basic information in the knowledge graph box on participants’ vaccination knowledge scores (F2,273=4.86, P=.01), skepticism/fear of vaccination side effects (F2,273=3.5, P=.03), and perceived information quality (F2,273=3.73, P=.02). More specifically, respondents receiving comprehensible information appeared to be more knowledgeable, less skeptical of vaccination, and more critical of information quality compared to participants exposed to hardly comprehensible information. Although, there was no significant interaction effect between the availability of information and the presence of the warning, there was a dominant pattern in which the presence of the warning appeared to have a positive influence on the group receiving comprehensible information while the opposite was true for the groups exposed to hardly comprehensible information and no information at all. Participants evaluated the knowledge graph box as moderately to highly useful, with no significant differences among the experimental groups. Conclusion Overall, the results suggest that comprehensible information in the knowledge graph box positively affects participants’ vaccination-related knowledge and attitudes. A small change in the content retrieval procedure currently used by Google could already make a valuable difference in the pursuit of an unbiased online information search. Further research is needed to gain insights into the knowledge graph box’s entire potential.},

This study was designed to assess the awareness and perception of coloring agents present in food and beverages on children's behavior among people of Jazan, Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional study was conducted on representative samples of 387 married people from different places in Jazan region of Saudi Arabia from August to December 2019. The study utilized a validated questionnaire consisting of 12 questions to gather the information from 387 participants (52.9\% males and 47.03\% females). Approximately 77\% were young adults; belong to age group of 26-45 years (P = 0.000). Majority (40.5\%) of them had four or more children (P = 0.000). While significant level of knowledge about the use of foods and beverages containing coloring agent was found in the participants (P = 0.001), they were not aware that it may affect the child's health. Only 24.7\% were able to tell the name of a coloring agent (P = 0.001). Significant percentage (88.9\%) of parents reported about child hyperactivity after consumption of specific type of food and beverages, particularly fizzy drinks (35.61\%), chocolates (31.82\%), and sweets and candy (30.3\%). Target populations were considered to be aware of presence of coloring agent in food and beverages used by their children regularly but they are not much aware of its harmful effect on long-term use.},

Le concept d'Anthropocène, s'il a le mérite de nommer le problème, peine à identifier les coupables et s'empêtre dans le récit millénaire d'une humanité pyromane. Or si l'on veut comprendre le réchauffement climatique, ce ne sont pas les archives de "l'espèce humaine" qu'il faut sonder mais celles de l'Empire britannique, pour commencer. On y apprend par exemple que dans les années 1830 la vapeur était, aux mains des capitalistes anglais, un outil redoutable pour discipliner la force de travail et une arme de guerre impérialiste ; on y suit la progression fulgurante de la machine mise au point par James Watt qui supplante en quelques années la force hydraulique - pourtant abondante et moins chère - dans l'industrie textile anglaise. En puisant dans les sources de l'histoire sociale, ce livre raconte l'avènement du "capital fossile", ou comment la combustion ininterrompue de charbon a permis de repousser les limites de l'exploitation et du profit. Il faut couper la mèche qui brûle avant que l'étincelle n'atteigne la dynamite, écrivait Walter Benjamin dans un fragment célèbre, "Avertisseur d'incendie", où il insistait sur la nécessité d'en finir avec le capitalisme avant qu'il ne s'autodétruise et emporte tout avec lui. Pour Andreas Malm, on ne peut mieux dire l'urgence contemporaine de défaire l'économie fossile par des mesures révolutionnaires."},

Façon Pieds Nickelés, ils ont même été jusqu’à mettre sur le web des preuves de leurs méfaits.

Although these have been compared to the Web of Science Core Collection (WoS), Scopus, or Google Scholar, there is no systematic evidence of their differences across subject categories. In response, this paper investigates 3,073,351 citations found by these six data sources to 2,515 English-language highly-cited documents published in 2006 from 252 subject categories, expanding and updating the largest previous study. Google Scholar found 88\% of all citations, many of which were not found by the other sources, and nearly all citations found by the remaining sources (89–94\%). A similar pattern held within most subject categories. Microsoft Academic is the second largest overall (60\% of all citations), including 82\% of Scopus citations and 86\% of WoS citations. In most categories, Microsoft Academic found more citations than Scopus and WoS (182 and 223 subject categories, respectively), but had coverage gaps in some areas, such as Physics and some Humanities categories. After Scopus, Dimensions is fourth largest (54\% of all citations), including 84\% of Scopus citations and 88\% of WoS citations. It found more citations than Scopus in 36 categories, more than WoS in 185, and displays some coverage gaps, especially in the Humanities. Following WoS, COCI is the smallest, with 28\% of all citations. Google Scholar is still the most comprehensive source. In many subject categories Microsoft Academic and Dimensions are good alternatives to Scopus and WoS in terms of coverage.},

  abstract = {Objective: We evaluated processing-speed and shift-cost measures in adults with depression or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and monitored the effects of treatment. We hypothesised that cognitive-speed and shift-cost measures might differentiate diagnostic groups. Methods: Colour, form, and colour-form stimuli were used to measure naming times. The shift costs were calculated as colour-form-naming time minus the sum of colour- and form-naming times. Measurements were done at baseline and end point for 42 adults with depression and 42 with ADHD without depression. Patients with depression were treated with transcranial pulsed electromagnetic fields and patients with ADHD with methylphenidate immediate release. Results: During depression treatment, reductions in naming times were recorded weekly. One-way analysis of variance indicated statistical between-group differences, with effect sizes in the medium range for form and colour-form. In both groups, naming times were longer before than after treatment. For the ADHD group, shift costs exceeded the average-normal range at baseline but were in the average-normal range after stabilisation with stimulant medication. For the depression group, shift costs were in the average-normal range at baseline and after treatment. Baseline colour-form-naming times predicted reductions in naming times for both groups, with the largest effect size and index of forecasting efficiency for the ADHD group. Conclusions: The cognitive-processing-speed (colour-form) and shift-cost measures before treatment proved most sensitive in differentiating patients with depression and ADHD. Reductions in naming times for the depression group were suggested to reflect improved psychomotor skills rather than improved cognitive control.},

  abstract = {Food additives have been used throughout history to perform specific functions in foods. A comprehensive framework of legislation is in place within Europe to control the use of additives in the food supply and ensure they pose no risk to human health. Further to this, exposure assessments are regularly carried out to monitor population intakes and verify that intakes are not above acceptable levels (acceptable daily intakes). Young children may have a higher dietary exposure to chemicals than adults due to a combination of rapid growth rates and distinct food intake patterns. For this reason, exposure assessments are particularly important in this age group. The paper will review the use of additives and exposure assessment methods and examine factors that affect dietary exposure by young children. One of the most widely investigated unfavourable health effects associated with food additive intake in preschool-aged children are suggested adverse behavioural effects. Research that has examined this relationship has reported a variety of responses, with many noting an increase in hyperactivity as reported by parents but not when assessed using objective examiners. This review has examined the experimental approaches used in such studies and suggests that efforts are needed to standardise objective methods of measuring behaviour in preschool children. Further to this, a more holistic approach to examining food additive intakes by preschool children is advisable, where overall exposure is considered rather than focusing solely on behavioural effects and possibly examining intakes of food additives other than food colours.},

  abstract = {Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic has placed online learning, blended or hybrid provision as the "new normal" in Higher Education. For most universities and their academic libraries, especially those with a less strong online presence, the pandemic has caused numerous challenges. However, it has also been a catalyst for change and resifting of priorities. For academic librarians involved in the delivery of information skills/literacy training, a renewed mission is emerging, addressing access and connectivity to resources, designing for online education and fostering the development of digital literacy of students. Design/methodology/approach This is a conceptual paper based on the author's personal experiences and subjective opinion as a Library and Information Science educator with considerable expertise in online distance learning in the UK. Reflecting critically on the impact of the pandemic from an educational point of view and on key changes experienced, the paper centres on the argument that academic librarians could emerge as strategic partners in Higher Education, towards the direction of enhancing students' digital competences development. Findings The complete and involuntary shift to online learning due to COVID-19 restrictions has opened the door to multiple challenges in Higher Education, which are complex and ongoing: the implementation of remote tools and practices en masse in online teaching and learning in a way that ensures accessibility and equity for all, issues connecting to online pedagogy and how to prepare students with the information and digital literacy competences required for the new online learning "normal". As academic libraries move forward, they have a renewed mission to help learners in the online space to become both information rich and digitally competent. There is an opportunity to act as the connecting link that will help to move a step forward a strategic vision that places design for equity at the centre of education. Originality/value The impact of COVID-19 within Higher Education and academic libraries more specifically, is a theme that has not been yet sufficiently discussed, researched or critically debated as the world is still currently going through the pandemic crisis. This paper aims to initiate some early thoughts and conversation, as well as put forward the author's personal critical positioning on the issues, challenges and potential opportunities, emerging in the current educational climate for academic librarians, and to highlight areas of importance for the design and direction of information and library science curricula.},

  abstract = {Due to the high amount of artificial food colorants present in infants' diets, their adverse effects have been of major concern among the literature. Artificial food colorants have been suggested to affect children's behavior, being hyperactivity the most common disorder. In this study we compare binding affinities of a group of artificial colorants (sunset yellow, quinoline yellow, carmoisine, allura red and tartrazine) and their natural industrial equivalents (carminic acid, curcumin, peonidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-glucoside) to human serum albumin (HSA) by a docking approach and further refinement through atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Due to the protein-ligand conformational interface complexity, we used collective variable driven molecular dynamics to refine docking predictions and to score them according to a hydrogen-bond criterion. With this protocol, we were able to rank ligand affinities to HSA and to compare between the studied natural and artificial food additives. Our results show that the five artificial colorants studied bind better to HSA than their equivalent natural options, in terms of their H-bonding network, supporting the hypothesis of their potential risk to human health.

But what they share is a tendency to repeat big, obvious lies -- a tactic researchers have dubbed the “firehose of falsehood.” Whether it’s lying about Russian troops in Crimea or falsely claiming millions of people voted illegally during the 2016 election, both leaders demonstrate a kind of shamelessness when it comes to telling and retelling big lies.

In this paper, we report the results of two deception studies whose goal was to better understand the critical relationship between Wikipedia and Google. These studies silently removed Wikipedia content from Google search results and examined the effect of doing so on participants’ interactions with both websites. Our findings demonstrate and characterize an extensive interdependence between Wikipedia and Google. Google becomes a worse search engine for many queries when it cannot surface Wikipedia content (e.g. click-through rates on results pages drop significantly) and the importance of Wikipedia content is likely greater than many improvements to search algorithms. Our results also highlight Google’s critical role in providing readership to Wikipedia. However, we also found evidence that this mutually beneficial relationship is in jeopardy: changes Google has made to its search results that involve directly surfacing Wikipedia content are significantly reducing traffic to Wikipedia. Overall, our findings argue that researchers and practitioners should give deeper consideration to the interdependence between peer production communities and the information technologies that use and surface their content.},

The checklist model is difficult to implement in practice and encourages a mechanistic way of evaluating that is at odds with critical thinking. A contextual approach is offered as an alternative. A contextual approach uses three techniques: promoting peer- and editorially-reviewed resources, comparison, and corroboration. The contextual approach promotes library resources, teaches information literacy, and encourages reasoned judgments of information quality.},

  abstract = {This article is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the role of dietary methods for treatment of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) when pharmacotherapy has proven unsatisfactory or unacceptable. Results of recent research and controlled studies, based on a PubMed search, are emphasized and compared with earlier reports. The recent increase of interest in this form of therapy for ADHD, and especially in the use of omega supplements, significance of iron deficiency, and the avoidance of the "Western pattern" diet, make the discussion timely. Diets to reduce symptoms associated with ADHD include sugar-restricted, additive/preservative-free, oligoantigenic/elimination, and fatty acid supplements. Omega-3 supplement is the latest dietary treatment with positive reports of efficacy, and interest in the additive-free diet of the 1970s is occasionally revived. A provocative report draws attention to the ADHD-associated "Western-style" diet, high in fat and refined sugars, and the ADHD-free "healthy" diet, containing fiber, folate, and omega-3 fatty acids. The literature on diets and ADHD, listed by PubMed, is reviewed with emphasis on recent controlled studies. Recommendations for the use of diets are based on current opinion of published reports and our practice experience. Indications for dietary therapy include medication failure, parental or patient preference, iron deficiency, and, when appropriate, change from an ADHD-linked Western diet to an ADHD-free healthy diet. Foods associated with ADHD to be avoided and those not linked with ADHD and preferred are listed. In practice, additive-free and oligoantigenic/elimination diets are time-consuming and disruptive to the household; they are indicated only in selected patients. Iron and zinc are supplemented in patients with known deficiencies; they may also enhance the effectiveness of stimulant therapy. In patients failing to respond or with parents opposed to medication, omega-3 supplements may warrant a trial. A greater attention to the education of parents and children in a healthy dietary pattern, omitting items shown to predispose to ADHD, is perhaps the most promising and practical complementary or alternative treatment of ADHD.},

  abstract = {Since prehistoric times, people have been fascinated with colors. From cave paintings to the latest gadgets, color has been a constant companion of humans. Coloring materials aka 'dyes' aren't just for fabrics but have been added to various types of food to enhance their appeal. Evidently, this coloring chemicals have their origin in natural products, which later expanded to the huge market of artificial food dyes. Artificial food colorings have been in the controversy for many years and scrutinized for being possibly linked to cancer, allergies and hyperactivity. Globally, natural as well as artificial dyes are being cautiously researched and regulated by the food safety authorities. In India, the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 (now called the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006), has been implemented for the quality assurance of various types of foods and food products, and only eight dyes have been suggested edible, but within prescribed limits. The present article explores the history and journey of these captivating materials which have been brightening our world for more than 3500 years, along with a detailed overview of their physical and chemical properties, and the usage and toxicity of the eight permissible food dyes in India.},

  abstract = {The scientific consensus on human-caused global warming has been a topic of intense interest in recent decades. This is in part due to the important role of public perception of expert consensus, which has downstream impacts on public opinion and support for mitigation policies. Numerous studies, using diverse methodologies and measures of climate expertise, have quantified the scientific consensus, finding between 90\% and 100\% agreement on human-caused global warming with multiple studies converging on 97\% agreement. This study revisits the consensus among geoscientists ten years after an initial survey of experts, while exploring different ways to define expertise and the level of agreement among these groups. We sent 10 929 invitations to participate in our survey to a verified email list of geosciences faculty at reporting academic and research institutions and received 2780 responses. In addition to analyzing the raw survey results, we independently quantify how many publications self-identified climate experts published in the field of climate change research and compare that to their survey response on questions about climate change. As well as a binary approach classifying someone as ‘expert’ or ‘non-expert’, we also look at expertise as a scale. We find that agreement on anthropogenic global warming is high (91\% to 100\%) and generally increases with expertise. Out of a group of 153 independently confirmed climate experts, 98.7\% of those scientists indicated that the Earth is getting warmer mostly because of human activity such as burning fossil fuels. Among those with the highest level of expertise (independently confirmed climate experts who each published 20+ peer reviewed papers on climate change between 2015 and 2019) there was 100\% agreement that the Earth is warming mostly because of human activity.},

  abstract = {Background: Treatment responses to methylphenidate by adults with ADHD are generally monitored against DSM-IV/DSM-V symptomatology, rating scales or interviews during reviews.Aims: To evaluate the use of single- and dual-dimension processing-speed and efficiency measures to monitor the effects of pharmacological treatment with methylphenidate after a short period off medication.Methods: A Quick Test of Cognitive Speed (AQT) monitored the effects of immediate-release methylphenidate in 40 previously diagnosed and medicated adults with ADHD. Processing speed was evaluated with prior prescription medication, without medication after a 2-day period off ADHD medication, and with low-dose (10/20mg) and high-dose (20/40mg) methylphenidate hydrochloride (Medikinet IR).Results: Thirty-three participants responded to the experimental treatments. One-way ANOVA with post-hoc analysis (Scheffe) indicated significant main effects for single dimension colour and form and dual-dimension colour-form naming. Post-hoc analysis indicated statistical differences between the no- and high-dose medication conditions for colour and form, measures of perceptual speed. For colour-form naming, a measure of cognitive speed, there was a significant difference between no- and low-dose medication and between no- and high-dose medications, but not between low- and high-dose medications.Conclusions: Results indicated that the AQT tests effectively monitored incremental effects of the methylphenidate dose on processing speed after a 2-day period off medication. Thus, perceptual (colour and form) and cognitive speed (two-dimensional colour-form naming) and processing efficiency (lowered shift costs) increased measurably with high-dose medication. These preliminary findings warrant validation with added measures of associated behavioural and cognitive changes.},

Method: Color (C), form (F), and color-form (CF) combination naming were administered to 69 adults during outpatient evaluation, and pre- and posttreatment results were compared for 64 adults. Results: At intake without medication, naming times (s) were significantly longer and overhead, CF - (C + F), larger than after stabilization of ADHD symptoms. Means for single-dimension naming were in the normal range, and for CF and overhead, means were in the atypical ranges. After treatment, CF and overhead improved to within normal ranges. On average, dual-dimension processing speed increased by 31\% and efficiency by 73\%. Sensitivity at intake was 91\%, using fail-criteria for CF and/or overhead. Conclusion: Results support previous estimates of sensitivity and ability to monitor pharmacological-treatment effects in ADHD. (J. of Att. Dis. 2013; 17(3)187-193)},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The role of diet and of food colors in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or its symptoms warrants updated quantitative meta-analysis, in light of recent divergent policy in Europe and the United States. METHOD: Studies were identified through a literature search using the PubMed, Cochrane Library, and PsycNET databases through February 2011. Twenty-four publications met inclusion criteria for synthetic food colors; 10 additional studies informed analysis of dietary restriction. A random-effects meta-analytic model generated summary effect sizes. RESULTS: Restriction diets reduced ADHD symptoms at an effect of g = 0.29 (95\% CI, 0.07-0.53). For food colors, parent reports yielded an effect size of g = 0.18 (95\% CI, 0.08-0.24; p = .0007), which decreased to 0.12 (95\% CI, 0.01-0.23; p {$<$} .05) after adjustment for possible publication bias. The effect was reliable in studies restricted to food color additives (g = 0.21, 95\% CI = 0.06-0.36) but did not survive correction for possible publication bias and was not reliable in studies confined to Food and Drug Administration-approved food colors. Teacher/observer reports yielded a nonsignificant effect of 0.07 (95\% CI = -0.03 to 0.18; p = .14). However, high-quality studies confined to color additives yielded a reliable effect (g = 0.22, 95\% CI = 0.10-0.41, p = .030) that survived correction. In psychometric tests of attention, the summary effect size was 0.27 (95\% CI = 0.07-0.47; p = .007) and survived correction. An estimated 8\% of children with ADHD may have symptoms related to synthetic food colors. CONCLUSIONS: A restriction diet benefits some children with ADHD. Effects of food colors were notable were but susceptible to publication bias or were derived from small, nongeneralizable samples. Renewed investigation of diet and ADHD is warranted.},

  abstract = {Are citizens willing to accept journalistic fact-checks of misleading claims from candidates they support and to update their attitudes about those candidates? Previous studies have reached conflicting conclusions about the effects of exposure to counter-attitudinal information. As fact-checking has become more prominent, it is therefore worth examining how respondents respond to fact-checks of politicians—a question with important implications for understanding the effects of this journalistic format on elections. We present results to two experiments conducted during the 2016 campaign that test the effects of exposure to realistic journalistic fact-checks of claims made by Donald Trump during his convention speech and a general election debate. These messages improved the accuracy of respondents’ factual beliefs, even among his supporters, but had no measurable effect on attitudes toward Trump. These results suggest that journalistic fact-checks can reduce misperceptions but often have minimal effects on candidate evaluations or vote choice.},

  abstract = {Purpose Fruits and vegetables, being good source of energy, health promoting and protecting compounds with unique taste and flavor, are attracting consumers since ages. These horticultural produces start deterioration just after harvest; therefore, their proper storage is must during transportation and storage to retain maximum quality parameters and for good market value. Best storage conditions are required to prevent growth of micro flora and to maintain the nutritional values of harvested produce. Retailers and processors in every corner of world want to move toward the cheaper ways to increase the shelf life and texture of horticultural crops for better consumer preference. The purpose of this paper is to make consumers and researchers aware about different post harvest malpractices in fresh fruits and vegetables. Design/methodology/approach Lot of chemicals like colors, artificial ripening agents, sweeteners and waxes are applied on surface of horticulture produce to siphon off money from consumers, and these have adverse health effects directly or indirectly. Various regulatory agencies have launched various programs, acts and laws for monitoring and avoiding such unhealthy ways. Regulatory bodies launched training programs also for the food handlers and consumers to ensure the food safety from farm to fork. Findings This paper will throw light on different malpractices followed by retailers to manipulate the quality which causes adverse health effects and to create consumer awareness regarding such malpractices. Originality/value The paper emphasizes on current malpractices followed by retailers to mislead the consumers about fruits' and vegetable' quality by using sweeteners, colors and other chemical. On prolonged consumption, such substances lead to major health issues such as attention disorder.},

The review uncovers the following themes: faculty and librarians perceive first-year students as lacking IL skills; students have varying perceptions of their IL skills; assessment studies yield conflicting findings on first-year students' IL; communication between high school and college librarians is challenging; and some IL researchers emphasise and leverage first-year students' prior knowledge and experience in IL instruction. These themes emerge from extensive searches in four research databases for scholarly and professional articles written in English within the past ten years. With the exception of a few articles, studies reviewed consistently express their findings in terms of students’ gaps or deficits. We question whether this is the most productive basis for developing effective IL programs. Instead, we call for further investigation of students’ existing knowledge and skills as a basis for implementing constructivist and strengths-based pedagogies.},

  abstract = {Misinformation can amplify humanity's greatest challenges. A salient recent example of this is the COVID-19 pandemic, which has bred a multitude of falsehoods even as truth has increasingly become a matter of life-and-death. Here we investigate why people believe and spread false (and true) news content about COVID-19, and test an intervention intended to increase the truthfulness of the content people share on social media. Across two studies with over 1,600 participants (quota-matched to the American public on age, gender, ethnicity and geographic region), we find support for the idea that people share false claims about COVID-19 in part because they simply fail to think sufficiently about whether or not content is accurate when deciding what to share. In Study 1, participants were far worse at discerning between true and false content when deciding what they would share on social media relative to when they are asked directly about accuracy. Furthermore, participants who engaged in more analytic thinking and had greater science knowledge were more discerning in their belief and sharing. In Study 2, we found that a simple accuracy reminder at the beginning of the study – i.e., asking people to judge the accuracy of a non-COVID-19-related headline – more than doubled the level of truth discernment in participants’ sharing intentions. In the control, participants were equally like to say they would share false versus true headlines at COVID-19 whereas, in the treatment, sharing of true headlines was significantly higher than false headlines. Our results – which mirror those found previously for political fake news – suggest that nudging people to think about accuracy is a simple way to improve choices about what to share on social media. Accuracy nudges are straightforward for social media platforms to implement on top of the other approaches they are currently employing, and could have an immediate positive impact on stemming the tide of misinformation about the COVID-19 outbreak.},

  abstract = {What can be done to combat political misinformation? One prominent intervention involves attaching warnings to headlines of news stories that have been disputed by third-party fact-checkers. Here we demonstrate a hitherto unappreciated potential consequence of such a warning: an implied truth effect, whereby false headlines that fail to get tagged are considered validated and thus are seen as more accurate. With a formal model, we demonstrate that Bayesian belief updating can lead to such an implied truth effect. In Study 1 (n = 5,271 MTurkers), we find that although warnings do lead to a modest reduction in perceived accuracy of false headlines relative to a control condition (particularly for politically concordant headlines), we also observed the hypothesized implied truth effect: the presence of warnings caused untagged headlines to be seen as more accurate than in the control. In Study 2 (n = 1,568 MTurkers), we find the same effects in the context of decisions about which headlines to consider sharing on social media. We also find that attaching verifications to some true headlines—which removes the ambiguity about whether untagged headlines have not been checked or have been verified—eliminates, and in fact slightly reverses, the implied truth effect. Together these results contest theories of motivated reasoning while identifying a potential challenge for the policy of using warning tags to fight misinformation—a challenge that is particularly concerning given that it is much easier to produce misinformation than it is to debunk it.This paper was accepted by Elke Weber, judgment and decision making.},

And about 13\% of the teachers emphasized to their students that creationism was a valid scientific alternative to modern evolutionary biology. In this paper, we investigate how the quality of evolution teaching, as measured by teachers’ reports of their teaching practices with regard to evolution and creationism, has changed in the intervening 12~years.},

  abstract = {Plant beneficial microbes (PBMs), such as plant growth-promoting bacteria, rhizobia, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and Trichoderma, can reduce the use of agrochemicals and increase plant yield, nutrition, and tolerance to biotic-abiotic stresses. Yet, large-scale applications of PBM have been hampered by the high amounts of inoculum per plant or per cultivation area needed for successful colonization and consequently the economic feasibility. Seed coating, a process that consists in covering seeds with low amounts of exogenous materials, is gaining attention as an efficient delivery system for PBM. Microbial seed coating comprises the use of a binder, in some cases a filler, mixed with inocula, and can be done using simple mixing equipment (e.g., cement mixer) or more specialized/sophisticated apparatus (e.g., fluidized bed). Binders/fillers can be used to extend microbial survival. The most reported types of seed coating are seed dressing, film coating, and pelleting. Tested in more than 50 plant species with seeds of different dimensions, forms, textures, and germination types (e.g., cereals, vegetables, fruits, pulses, and other legumes), seed coating has been studied using various species of plant growth-promoting bacteria, rhizobia, Trichoderma, and to a lesser extent mycorrhizal fungi. Most of the studies regarding PBM applied via seed coating are aimed at promoting crop growth, yield, and crop protection against pathogens. Studies have shown that coating seeds with PBM can assist crops in improving seedling establishment and germination or achieving high yields and food quality, under reduced chemical fertilization. The right combination of biological control agents applied via seed coating can be a powerful tool against a wide number of diseases and pathogens. Less frequently, studies report seed coating being used for adaptation and protection of crops under abiotic stresses. Notwithstanding the promising results, there are still challenges mainly related with the scaling up from the laboratory to the field and proper formulation, including efficient microbial combinations and coating materials that can result in extended shelf-life of both seeds and coated PBM. These limitations need to be addressed and overcome in order to allow a wider use of seed coating as a cost-effective delivery method for PBM in sustainable agricultural systems.},

Methods             Published and preprint randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing IVM effects on COVID-19 adult patients were searched until March 15, 2021 in five engines. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, length of stay (LOS), and adverse events (AE). Secondary outcomes included viral clearance and severe AEs. We evaluated risk of bias (RoB) using the Cochrane RoB 2·0 tool. Inverse variance random effect meta-analyses were performed with quality of evidence (QoE) evaluated using GRADE methodology. Subgroup analyses by severity of disease and RoB, and sensitivity analyses by time of follow-up were conducted.                                   Results             Ten RCTs (n=1173) were included. Controls were standard of care [SOC] in five RCTs and placebo in five RCTs. RCTs sample size ranged from 24 to 398 patients, mean age from 26 to 56 years-old, and severity of COVID-19 disease was mild in 8 RCTs, moderate in one RCT, and mild and moderate in one RCT. IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality vs. controls (RR 0.37, 95\%CI 0.12 to 1.13, very low QoE). IVM did not reduce LOS vs. controls (MD 0.72 days, 95\%CI -0.86 to 2.29, very low QoE). AEs, severe AE and viral clearance were similar between IVM and controls (low QoE for these three outcomes). Subgroups by severity of COVID-19 or RoB were mostly consistent with main analyses; all-cause mortality in three RCTs at high RoB was reduced with IVM. Sensitivity analyses excluding RCTs with follow up {$<$}21 days showed no difference in all-cause mortality.                                   Conclusions             In comparison to SOC or placebo, IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality, length of stay or viral clearance in RCTs in COVID-19 patients with mostly mild disease. IVM did not have effect on AEs or SAEs. IVM is not a viable option to treat COVID-19 patients.},

To help counter this, we developed a ‘fake news game’ in which participants are actively tasked with creating a news article about a strongly politicized issue (the European refugee crisis) using misleading tactics, from the perspective of different types of fake news producers. To pilot test the efficacy of the game, we conducted a randomized field study (N = 95) in a public high school setting. Results provide some preliminary evidence that playing the fake news game reduced the perceived reliability and persuasiveness of fake news articles. Overall, these findings suggest that educational games may be a promising vehicle to inoculate the public against fake news.},

In a novel attempt to address this issue, we designed a psychological intervention in the form of an online browser game. In the game, players take on the role of a fake news producer and learn to master six documented techniques commonly used in the production of misinformation: polarisation, invoking emotions, spreading conspiracy theories, trolling people online, deflecting blame, and impersonating fake accounts. The game draws on an inoculation metaphor, where preemptively exposing, warning, and familiarising people with the strategies used in the production of fake news helps confer cognitive immunity when exposed to real misinformation. We conducted a large-scale evaluation of the game with N\,=\,15,000 participants in a pre-post gameplay design. We provide initial evidence that people’s ability to spot and resist misinformation improves after gameplay, irrespective of education, age, political ideology, and cognitive style.},

Providing reliable resources with minimal barriers to access involves cooperation among librarians, publishers, and vendors; however, I suggest that there is tension between our mutual desires to satisfy student demands for instant and perfect results and to encourage them to become persistent and critical information seekers. Many tools exist to assist students in gaining background information and limiting search results, but ultimately none replace the need to develop and explore questions and to evaluate information sources. In this paper, I reflect on the difficulties of persuading students to persist in using library resources and the use of Bernard Lonergan’s generalized empirical method as a framework for critical thinking and information literacy.},

  abstract = {Tartrazine is an azo food dye, which is orange-colored and water soluble. It is usually used in foods, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and textiles. Tartrazine has the potential to cause an adverse health effect on humans, such as hyperactivity in children, allergy, and asthma. Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additive and EU Scientific Committee for Food have standardized the acceptable daily intake for tartrazine that is 7.5 mg kg(-1) body weight. Many researchers have detected the presence of tartrazine for monitoring the quality and safety of food products. In this review paper, we highlighted various tartrazine detection and extraction methods. Some of the analytical methods are available such as high-performance liquid chromatography, electrochemical sensor, thin-layer chromatography, spectrophotometry, capillary electrophoresis, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Also, we discuss following extraction steps: liquid-liquid extraction, solid-phase extraction, membrane filtration, cloud point extraction, and other extraction method. In addition, a brief overview is presented explaining the synthesis process and metabolism of tartrazine and the maximum permitted level in different countries. This review paper will give an insight into different extraction and analytical methods for the determination of tartrazine in healthy foods, which will attract the attention of public toward food safety and quality, and also the interest of food industry and government bodies.},

  abstract = {Un phénomène impensable est en train de se produire : l’agonie du néolibéralisme. Tous ses excès – et la crise du covid – ont confirmé sa nocivité. Nous nous mettons alors à espérer un monde plus juste qui adviendrait grâce au retour de l’État providence, à la prise en compte des questions écologiques et à une participation citoyenne accrue. Un véritable paysage de carte postale en somme. Or, rien de cela ne nous sauvera du pouvoir des algorithmes, de la marchandisation intégrale de nos vies par l’industrie numérique, ou du déploiement d’une télésocialité contribuant à notre « isolement collectif ». Autant de processus qui engendrent de nouveaux types d’assujettissement, ignorés de la « grande politique ». Si nous savons que l’enjeu majeur de notre époque est d’être partie prenante des affaires qui nous regardent, cette aspiration prend des formes trop éparses, ne répondant à aucun projet commun défini en ce sens. À contre-courant de cette tendance, ce livre renouvelle les perspectives d’émancipation, en dressant un registre d’actions concrètes. Cela suppose de mener une critique des discours défendant des intérêts privés, de ne plus subir de situations iniques et de constituer un foisonnement de collectifs – dans tous les domaines de la vie – favorisant l’expérimentation, la meilleure expression de chacun, tout en étant soucieux de ne léser ni personne, ni la biosphère. Après tant de désillusions, le moment est venu de ne plus nous en remettre à des instances tierces pour nous engager dans une impérieuse et salutaire politique de nous-mêmes. (4e de couverture)},

  abstract = {The E number system for food additives was introduced in the 1960s and the E was intended to reassure consumers that permitted additives were safe. In the 1980s full ingredient declarations had to be provided on food products for the first time and manufacturers were permitted to use either the name or the number of the additive on the ingredient list. This paper outlines some of the trends in the sourcing, use and labelling of additives since the introduction of full ingredient listing. Generally, sourcing has become more global with a large number of suppliers being based in China. From an initial use of E numbers in ingredient lists, manufacturers are increasingly using the names of additives. This trend is being extended to avoid the use of anything the consumer might consider an additive, particularly in connection with colours and preservatives. Specifically, the colours used in the Southampton study on the impact of food colours on hyperactivity in children have largely been replaced by colouring foodstuffs, and the preservative used in the study, sodium benzoate, has been replaced by potassium sorbate in the majority of soft drinks.

Drawing on ingratiation theory, we model the effects of flattery, self-deprecation, opinion conformity, and self-promotion as distinct forms of ingratiation rhetoric. We do so independently and in tandem, conceptualizing the confluence of ingratiation forms as driving an overall aggregate effect on the amount of funding allocated by investors. We then theorize that entrepreneur charisma and entrepreneur performance are moderators of the aggregate effect. We test our model in the angel investment context with data from 789 entrepreneur pitch presentations to 27 investors on the Shark Tank television program from 2009 through 2020. We find that on their own, the different forms of ingratiation rhetoric have mixed effects, with flattery and self-deprecation negatively impacting investor funding amount and opinion conformity and self-promotion positively relating to funding amount. When used together, we find an overall negative effect, and this effect is positively moderated by entrepreneur charisma and entrepreneur performance. These findings shed new light on ingratiation rhetoric as a powerful force in entrepreneurs' efforts to secure funding.},

Among them, we explored the usefulness of the Percentage of Papers by the Most Prolific author (PPMP) and the Gini index (level of inequality in the distribution of authorship among authors) as tools to identify journals that may show favoritism in accepting articles by specific authors. We examined whether the PPMP, complemented by the Gini index, could be useful for identifying cases of potential editorial bias, using all articles in a sample of 5,468 biomedical journals indexed in the National Library of Medicine. For articles published between 2015 and 2019, the median PPMP was 2.9\%, and 5\% of journal exhibited a PPMP of 10.6\% or more. Among the journals with the highest PPMP or Gini index values, where a few authors were responsible for a disproportionate number of publications, a random sample was manually examined, revealing that the most prolific author was part of the editorial board in 60 cases (61\%). The papers by the most prolific authors were more likely to be accepted for publication within 3 weeks of their submission. Results of analysis on a subset of articles, excluding nonresearch articles, were consistent with those of the principal analysis. In most journals, publications are distributed across a large number of authors. Our results reveal a subset of journals where a few authors, often members of the editorial board, were responsible for a disproportionate number of publications. To enhance trust in their practices, journals need to be transparent about their editorial and peer review practices.},

  abstract = {This surprising study of online political mobilization shows that money and organizational sophistication influence politics online as much as off, and casts doubt on the democratizing power of digital activism.The internet has been hailed as a leveling force that is reshaping activism. From the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street to Black Lives Matter and \#MeToo, digital activism seemed cheap, fast, and open to all. Now this celebratory narrative finds itself competing with an increasingly sinister story as platforms like Facebook and Twitter―once the darlings of digital democracy―are on the defensive for their role in promoting fake news. While hashtag activism captures headlines, conservative digital activism is proving more effective on the ground.In this sharp-eyed and counterintuitive study, Jen Schradie shows how the web has become another weapon in the arsenal of the powerful. She zeroes in on workers’ rights advocacy in North Carolina and finds a case study with broad implications. North Carolina’s hard-right turn in the early 2010s should have alerted political analysts to the web’s antidemocratic potential: amid booming online organizing, one of the country’s most closely contested states elected the most conservative government in North Carolina’s history.The Revolution That Wasn’t identifies the reasons behind this previously undiagnosed digital-activism gap. Large hierarchical political organizations with professional staff can amplify their digital impact, while horizontally organized volunteer groups tend to be less effective at translating online goodwill into meaningful action. Not only does technology fail to level the playing field, it tilts it further, so that only the most sophisticated and well-funded players can compete.},

La société nouvelle, globalisée, est en effet dominée par ce que Tocqueville aurait pu appeler le "Monstre doux", le modèle tentaculaire et diffus d'une culture puissamment attirante, au visage à la fois souriant et sinistre, qui promet satisfaction et bien-être à tous en s'assurant de l'endormissement des conciences par la possession et la consommation tout en entretenant la confusion en fiction et réalité."},

  abstract = {In debates over diagnoses of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and use of the drug Ritalin among the American school age population, discussion often centers around who is to blame for rising diagnoses and increasing use of Ritalin. Parents have come under particular scrutiny by critics who associate ADHD behaviors in children with poor parenting and view Ritalin as a “quick-fix” for socially situated problems. Biologically oriented researchers of ADHD, on the other hand have posited organically based dysfunction as the cause of ADHD behaviors. This paper explores the problem of blame in relation to ADHD diagnoses and Ritalin use from the perspective of mothers of boys with ADHD. Qualitative interviews with mothers suggest that medicalization of problematic behaviors in young boys includes an inherent narrative of blame transformation; this transformation can be expressed as a binarism: mother-blame–brain-blame. The first two sections of the paper document mothers’ experiences of blame for their sons’ symptomatic behaviors against the background of a cultural mothering ideology. The third section considers the promise of absolution from mother-blame inherent in the transformative binary structure. I argue that medicalization of boys’ problem behaviors supports and reconstitutes the potential for mother-blame and does little to pierce oppressive cultural mothering ideals.},

This chapter addresses this gap by developing an understanding of political information literacy and challenges the premise that information professionals and information organizations should remain neutral in the face of phenomena like censorship through noise and disinformation. In this endeavor, it reviews contemporary information environments vis-à-vis the growth of fake news and misinformation, and current information literacy approaches utilized by information organizations. Thereafter, it explores several cognitive barriers, such as the role of confirmation bias, information avoidance, information groupishness, and information overload, which affects people’s ability to process information. Finally, it encourages information professionals to hold regular information sessions on politically charged topics, tackle the cognitive factors increasing misinformation, and cultivate multidisciplinary approaches to confront fake news.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The occurrence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has significantly increased in the last few years. One of the common problems in this group are eating disorders and ailments from the gastrointestinal systems. According to some studies, these problems have a significant impact on the occurrence and severity of symptoms in the neurological system, so it is crucial to increase the attention paid on the role of diet in the treatment of this disease. One of the theories connects ASD with disorders of the digestive system and the intestinal bacterial flora. This theory is based on the gut-brain axis, which means the interaction between the gastrointestinal and nervous systems. Objectives: To demonstrate the differences in behavior habits, interest in nutrition, and frequency of consumption of food products between children suffering from ASD and healthy children. Materials and methods: The study was conducted among 44 children suffering from ASD and 33 healthy children as a control group. Data were collected using a questionnaire that was specially designed for this study. The questionnaire contained questions about eating habits and the frequency of consumption of selected food products. Results: Parents of healthy children showed more interest in their children's way of feeding and nutritional recommendations compared to parents of children with ASD (4\% and 11.3\%, respectively). In addition, 24.3\% more children with ASD consulted with a nutritionist compared to the control group. Complaints of the digestive system were 21.1\% more likely by children with ASD. Children suffering from ASD were characterized by a higher intake of red meat and giblets and less frequent consumption of milk and milk products compared to the control group. There were no statistically significant differences between the study group and the control group in terms of frequency of consumption of products, which are the source of gluten, artificial food additives-preservatives, and artificial colors. Conclusions: There are differences in the habits and eating behaviors and the frequency of consumption of selected food products between a group of children with ASD and a group of healthy children.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Nonpharmacological treatments are available for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), although their efficacy remains uncertain. The authors undertook meta-analyses of the efficacy of dietary (restricted elimination diets, artificial food color exclusions, and free fatty acid supplementation) and psychological (cognitive training, neurofeedback, and behavioral interventions) ADHD treatments. METHOD: Using a common systematic search and a rigorous coding and data extraction strategy across domains, the authors searched electronic databases to identify published randomized controlled trials that involved individuals who were diagnosed with ADHD (or who met a validated cutoff on a recognized rating scale) and that included an ADHD outcome. RESULTS: Fifty-four of the 2,904 nonduplicate screened records were included in the analyses. Two different analyses were performed. When the outcome measure was based on ADHD assessments by raters closest to the therapeutic setting, all dietary (standardized mean differences=0.21-0.48) and psychological (standardized mean differences=0.40-0.64) treatments produced statistically significant effects. However, when the best probably blinded assessment was employed, effects remained significant for free fatty acid supplementation (standardized mean difference=0.16) and artificial food color exclusion (standardized mean difference=0.42) but were substantially attenuated to nonsignificant levels for other treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Free fatty acid supplementation produced small but significant reductions in ADHD symptoms even with probably blinded assessments, although the clinical significance of these effects remains to be determined. Artificial food color exclusion produced larger effects but often in individuals selected for food sensitivities. Better evidence for efficacy from blinded assessments is required for behavioral interventions, neurofeedback, cognitive training, and restricted elimination diets before they can be supported as treatments for core ADHD symptoms.},

Dans "Saison brune", Philippe Squarzoni tisse un récit inédit, qui entremêle analyses scientifiques et interviews de spécialistes, considérations personnelles et hommages au cinéma, enquête politique et essai engagé. Le livre est découpé en six chapitres. Les deux premiers chapitres sont consacrés aux aspects scientifiques du réchauffement : le fonctionnement du climat, la description de l'effet de serre, l'augmentation des gaz à effet de serre dans l'atmosphère durant l'époque moderne. Mais aussi l'expertise menée par le GIEC, l'attribution du réchauffement aux activités humaines, les différents scénarios d'augmentation des températures à venir, les risques d'effets de seuil, les risques de rétroactions positives. Dans les deux chapitres suivants, Philippe Squarzoni alterne entre l'examen des conséquences à venir du réchauffement climatique (fonte des glaciers, montée des eaux, multiplication des tempêtes, risques de sécheresse dans certaines régions...) et les questionnements du narrateur et de sa compagne face à cette situation inédite.Dans les deux derniers chapitres, Squarzoni élargit son questionnement et examine les possibilités de réduction des émissions et les différents scénarios énergétiques qui s'offrent à nos sociétés (énergies renouvelables, nucléaire, progrès technologiques, maîtrise de l'énergie...). Entre les insuffisances des unes, et les faux espoirs des autres, il décrit une alternative possible qui permettrait d'éviter les conséquences les plus graves du réchauffement climatique. Et les choix politiques, les modèles de société, que ces scénarios impliquent.},

In the past 38 years, there have been studies of adverse behavioral reactions such as hyperactivity in children to double-blind challenges with AFCs. Studies that used 50 mg or more of AFCs as the challenge showed a greater negative effect on more children than those which used less. The study reported here is the first to quantify the amounts of AFCs in foods (specifically in beverages) commonly consumed by children in the United States. Consumption data for all foods would be helpful in the design of more challenge studies. The data summarized here should help clinicians advise parents about AFCs and beverage consumption.},

Oligoantigenic diet studies suggested that some children in addition to being sensitive to AFCs are also sensitive to common nonsalicylate foods (milk, chocolate, soy, eggs, wheat, corn, legumes) as well as salicylate-containing grapes, tomatoes, and orange. Some studies found "cosensitivity" to be more the rule than the exception. Recently, 2 large studies demonstrated behavioral sensitivity to AFCs and benzoate in children both with and without ADHD.

Many early studies found few children who reacted to challenges with 20-40\,mg of AFCs. However, studies using at least 50\,mg of AFCs showed a greater percentage of children who reacted to the challenge. Three types of potential mechanisms are explored: toxicological, antinutritional, and hypersensitivity. Suggestions for future studies in animals and/or children include dose studies as well as studies to determine the effects of AFCs on the immune system, the intestinal mucosa, and nutrient absorption. Given the potential negative behavioral effects of AFCs, it is important to determine why some children may be more sensitive to AFCs than others and to identify the tolerable upper limits of exposure for children in general and for children at high risk.},

La stratégie de l’omerta n’est pas la bonne.

Exactly how they might leverage that trust remains unclear and untested. Building on recent work in correcting health misperceptions on social media, this study tests whether libraries can leverage trust to combat misinformation online. Using a misperception about the influenza vaccine as a test case, an experiment (n\,=\,625) was conducted in fall 2018 using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Results suggest that the misperception can be reduced, but not by library institutions. An unsuccessful follow-up (n\,=\,600) suggests that the effectiveness of the correction is season dependent and opens the possibility that libraries may yet play a role, but not necessarily because they are trusted. Future library proposals for combating misinformation need to be developed and tested within a broader contemporary misinformation research program.},

The response from the profession has been to reaffirm the core values of librarianship and to hold up traditional services as a means for combating misinformation. The problem is that these solutions are offered in the absence of a full understanding of the real danger of misinformation, which is “not just [that] misinformation is ‘out there,’” but “what misinformation does to our mind” (Ecker, 2015: 22). Misinformation research in other fields directly challenges the solutions proposed by library professionals and casts doubts on their underlying assumptions. This article provides an overview of the library and information science approach to misinformation in the United States, discusses the shortcomings of that approach, and points to possible next steps for remedying the problem.},

  abstract = {Jeffrey Beall, a US librarian, coined the term “predatory publishing” specifically to describe a movement or phenomenon of open access (OA) journals and publishers that he and others believed displayed exploitative and unscholarly principles. Using a blog to transmit those ideas, and profiling specific cases using blacklists, one of the most polemic aspects of Beall's blog was its tendency to attract and incite academic radicalism. Beall targeted both publishers and standalone journals, but how he precisely determined that an OA journal or a publisher was predatory was in many cases an ambiguity. Beall's deficient and highly subjective criteria, as well as those blacklists' incapacity to clearly distinguish low quality OA publishers from predatory ones, may have negatively impacted the operations of several Beall-blacklisted OA journals and publishers. Freedom of speech that embraces prejudice, via Beall's blog, and the establishment of “predatory” blacklists, are enhanced discriminatory ideologies that continue to be carried downstream from Beall to and by other like-minded individuals and groups who proliferate academic divisiveness and may also be formalizing and institutionalizing a culture of discriminative philosophies by cloning Beall's blacklists and encouraging their continued use.},

Quelques mois plus tard, l'épidémie de Covid-19 offrait, à l'échelle mondiale, un cas d'usage frappant des dispositifs que je m'étais efforcé de décrire.On a vu des officines de toutes tailles, hier positionnées sur le juteux secteur de la sécurité, pivoter vers un nouvel impératif, celui de la traque des corps malades – un levier encore plus puissant que la lutte contre le terrorisme. Des applications de traçage, de "suivi des contacts', ont été développées un peu partout, misant sur le numérique pour endiguer la course du virus. Dans le ciel, des drones sortis d'un futur proche ont fait respecter le confinement. On a confié à des caméras le soin de s'assurer du port du masque et du respect de la distanciation sociale.La crise sanitaire a mis au jour la présence de ces dispositifs de surveillance toujours plus nombreux, dont elle a dans le même temps assis la légitimité et accéléré la banalisation.

  abstract = {Purpose/Thesis: The article focuses on digital wisdom, defined by Marc Prensky as the ability to use modern computer technology wisely to improve thinking and decision-making and to better share the results of research. The aim of this article is to present some of the digital tools that increase the efficiency of scientific research and facilitate conceptual work, information retrieval, note-taking and writing up of research.  Approach/Methods: The research process comprised several stages, each of which focused on a specific tool that directly increases work efficiency and performs functions beyond human capabilities.  Results and conclusions: The latest digital tools are equipped with features that increase efficiency at all stages of the research process. They speed up the completion of a task (e.g. searching for information) and illuminate the relationships between documents or individual concepts that researchers themselves would not register (e.g. through the visualization of data and information).  Originality/Value: The skillful use of modern digital tools is a fundamental element of digital wisdom as computer programs and Web applications significantly broaden human perception and cognitive capabilities.},

Some children will experience food reactions to food additives. Reported symptoms range from urticaria/angioedema to hyperactive behaviours. While parents/carers report that over one fifth of children experience of food reaction, only 1 in 20 of these are confirmed to have a non-allergic food hypersensitivity on testing.},

  abstract = {Objective Attention Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Chronic Tic Disorder (CTD) are two common and frequently co-existing disorders, probably following an additive model. But this is not yet clear for the basic sensory function of colour processing sensitive to dopaminergic functioning in the retina and higher cognitive functions like attention and interference control. The latter two reflect important aspects for psychoeducation and behavioural treatment approaches. Methods Colour discrimination using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue Test, sustained attention during the Frankfurt Attention Inventory (FAIR), and interference liability during Colour- and Counting-Stroop-Tests were assessed to further clarify the cognitive profile of the co-existence of ADHD and CTD. Altogether 69 children were classified into four groups: ADHD (N = 14), CTD (N = 20), ADHD+CTD (N = 20) and healthy Controls (N = 15) and compared in cognitive functioning in a 2x2-factorial statistical model. Results Difficulties with colour discrimination were associated with both ADHD and CTD factors following an additive model, but in ADHD these difficulties tended to be more pronounced on the blue-yellow axis. Attention problems were characteristic for ADHD but not CTD. Interference load was significant in both Colour-and Counting-Stroop-Tests and unrelated to colour discrimination. Compared to Controls, interference load in the Colour-Stroop was higher in pure ADHD and in pure CTD, but not in ADHD+CTD, following a sub-additive model. In contrast, interference load in the Counting-Stroop did not reveal ADHD or CTD effects. Conclusion The co-existence of ADHD and CTD is characterized by additive as well as sub-additive performance impairments, suggesting that their co-existence may show simple additive characteristics of both disorders or a more complex interaction, depending on demand. The equivocal findings on interference control may indicate limited validity of the Stroop-Paradigm for clinical assessments.},

The aim of this systematic review was therefore to investigate the current knowledge of diet interventions as a treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents Methods:A systematic literature search in PubMed was conducted, identifying randomized controlled trials investigating diet interventions to treat ADHD in children and adolescents. Results:The study populations were generally small and the studies varied in duration and nature of the exposure. Overall 10 out of 12 studies spoke in favour of an elimination diet, 2 out of 6 of eliminating artificial food colourings from the diet and none in favour of eliminating sucrose or aspartame from the diet to treat ADHD. Conclusion:The current evidence is not enough to recommend treating ADHD with diet interventions, but a subgroup of children and adolescents might warrant from elimination of certain food-items. Further investigations of the mechanism and effect of diet interventions to treat ADHD is needed.},

  abstract = {Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) etiology is not completely understood, but common comorbid dysfunction of the gastrointestinal and immune system suggests that these systems may be affected by a common genetic background and molecular mechanisms. For example, increased levels of specific cytokines were observed in ADHD. Moreover, ADHD has a high comorbidity with both Th1- and Th2-mediated disorders like ear infections, eczema and asthma. A common pathophysiological mechanism was suggested to underlie both asthma and ADHD, while several genes that are linked to ADHD have immune functions. Furthermore, immunological recognition of food provoking ADHD-like behavior was suggested. An immune imbalance, probably requiring a predisposing genetic background, is therefore suggested to contribute to ADHD etiology, with immune dysregulation being more likely than a single subcellular defect. However, next to allergic mechanisms, also pharmacological mechanisms (especially in case of food additives) might be involved. In addition, though cellular (cytokine-related) rather than antibody-mediated immune mechanisms seem involved, specific immune-inflammatory markers other than antibodies have not been systematically studied in ADHD. Substantial alterations implicated in ADHD apparently occur in the immune system and epigenetic regulation of gene expression. As a result, chronic inflammation and oxidative stress could develop, which can lead to ADHD symptoms, for example by chronic T-cell-mediated neuroinflammation. If immune pathways contribute to ADHD, both its diagnosis and treatment should be reconsidered. Modulation of immune system activity might have potential in ADHD treatment, for example by nutritional approaches providing safe and low-cost ADHD therapy, but further research in these fields is implicated.},

  abstract = {La maladie de Parkinson représente une atteinte particulière du système nerveux central, caractérisée par un dysfonctionnement chronique des noyaux gris centraux, dont le rôle est essentiel dans le contrôle de l'exécution des plans moteurs appris. Sa physiopathologie provoque une rigidité générale des muscles, des tremblements (surtout des membres) et une difficulté à démarrer les séquences motrices. Outre un ralentissement général des mouvements (bradykinésie) ses conséquences sur les muscles du conduit vocal et du larynx sont aggravées par un manque de sensations proprioceptives de la langue et de la mandibule provoqué par l'atteinte des ganglions de la base. Les troubles de la production de parole au cours de la maladie de Parkinson constituent un des marqueurs cliniques représentatifs de l'évolution du handicap moteur à l'instar d'autres activités motrices complexes comme les troubles de l'équilibre et de la marche. Les troubles de la parole pénalisent particulièrement l'autonomie des patients en détériorant leur capacité de communication au cours de l'évolution de la maladie La caractéristique principale des troubles de la production vocale observés au cours de la maladie de Parkinson est une dysarthrie qualifiée d'hypokinétique, ce terme faisant non seulement référence à la réduction des mouvements articulatoires mais aussi à la diminution de la modulation prosodique de la parole par ailleurs qualifiée de monotone.On constate au cours de la maladie une progression « caudo-rostrale » des troubles du conduit vocal, débutant au niveau laryngé pour atteindre ensuite la partie postérieure de la constriction linguo-palatine, puis sa partie antérieure et enfin la constriction bilabiale.La précession d'une dysphonie et de la dysprosodie est rapportée d'une manière générale chez les patients parkinsoniens avec handicap moteur faible et indépendants dans leur vie quotidienne. Les anomalies observées globalement sont une réduction d'intensité, une monotonie et un débit ralenti que l'on peut définir plus précisément par la diminution d'énergie du signal vocal, la réduction de variabilité de la hauteur (dynamique de la Fo) et l'augmentation du nombre de pauses « non remplies ». Comme elle apparaît dés les premières atteintes de la maladie, l'insuffisance prosodique constitue probablement la marque la plus spécifique des troubles de la parole dans la maladie de Parkinson.Apparaissent ensuite, des atteintes articulatoires qui dégradent progressivement l'intelligibilité.Outre l'imprécision des consonnes, déviance assez peu spécifique puisqu'elle est présente dans toutes les dysarthries, les anomalies articulatoires dans la maladie de Parkinson portent essentiellement sur les consonnes occlusives, lesquelles sont perçues comme des constrictives, témoignant d'une fermeture insuffisante du conduit vocal.Pour les voyelles, la tendance à la réduction de la surface du triangle vocalique rapportée chez les patients parkinsoniens peut rendre compte de la dédifférenciation des voyelles, ce qui contribue avec les phénomènes de spirantisation et de coarticulation à la réduction des contrastes acoustiques. L'image d'une trajectoire évolutive globale des troubles de la parole au cours de la maladie de Parkinson ne doit pas faire oublier la très grande variabilité interindividuelle du phénotype et de tenir compte de la problématique générale de reproductibilité des observations et des enregistrements chez un patient donné.},

Dans les entretiens d'embauche comme dans les rendez-vous galants. Pas un jour ne passe sans que nous ayons à défendre une idée, un projet, un produit ; et à nous protéger contre d'éventuelles fourberies. Que cela nous plaise ou non, convaincre est un pouvoir. A nous d'apprendre à le maîtriser. Et de savoir y résister. Car la rhétorique n'est ni innée, ni inexplicable. Elle repose sur une technique, obéit à des règles, mobilise des procédés, des stratagèmes, des outils. Dans ce traité accessible et concret, ponctué d'exemples et de cas pratiques, Clément Viktorovitch nous en révèle tous les secrets. Au fil des pages, il nous montre comment produire et décrypter les discours, mener les débats et les discussions, déjouer les manipulations. L'art de convaincre est un pouvoir trop grand pour ne pas être partagé ! (4e de couverture)},

  abstract = {Artificial food dyes are made from petroleum and have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the enhancement of the color of processed foods. They are widely used in the food and pharmaceutical industries to increase the appeal and acceptability of their products. Synthetic food colorants can achieve hues not possible for natural colorants and are cheaper, more easily available, and last longer. However, since the use of artificial food coloring has become widespread, many allergic and other immune reactive disorders have increasingly been reported. During the past 50 y, the amount of synthetic dye used in foods has increased by 500\%. Simultaneously, an alarming rise has occurred in behavioral problems in children, such as aggression, attention deficit disorder (ADD), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The ingestion of food delivers the greatest foreign antigenic load that challenges the immune system. Artificial colors can also be absorbed via the skin through cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. The molecules of synthetic colorants are small, and the immune system finds it difficult to defend the body against them. They can also bond to food or body proteins and, thus, are able to act in stealth mode to circumvent and disrupt the immune system. The consumption of synthetic food colors, and their ability to bind with body proteins, can have significant immunological consequences. This consumption can activate the inflammatory cascade, can result in the induction of intestinal permeability to large antigenic molecules, and could lead to cross-reactivities, autoimmunities, and even neurobehavioral disorders. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recently found a 41\% increase in diagnoses of ADHD in boys of high-school age during the past decade. More shocking is the legal amount of artificial colorants allowed by the FDA in the foods, drugs, and cosmetics that we consume and use every day. The consuming public is largely unaware of the perilous truth behind the deceptive allure of artificial color.},

  abstract = {Mass selection into groups of like-minded individuals may be fragmenting and polarizing online society, particularly with respect to partisan differences1–4. However, our ability to measure the social makeup of online communities and in turn, to understand the social organization of online platforms, is limited by the pseudonymous, unstructured and large-scale nature of digital discussion. Here we develop a neural-embedding methodology to quantify the positioning of online communities along social dimensions by leveraging large-scale patterns of aggregate behaviour. Applying our methodology to 5.1 billion comments made in 10,000 communities over 14 years on Reddit, we measure how the macroscale community structure is organized with respect to age, gender and US~political partisanship. Examining political content, we find that Reddit underwent a significant polarization event around the 2016 US~presidential election. Contrary to conventional wisdom, however, individual-level polarization is rare; the system-level shift in 2016 was disproportionately driven by the arrival of new users. Political polarization on Reddit is unrelated to previous activity on the platform and is instead temporally aligned with external events. We also observe a stark ideological asymmetry, with the sharp increase in polarization in 2016 being entirely attributable to changes in right-wing activity. This methodology is broadly applicable to the study of online interaction, and our findings have implications for the design of online platforms, understanding the social contexts of online behaviour, and quantifying the dynamics and mechanisms of online polarization.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The proposition that synthetic food colors can induce adverse behavioral effects in children was first enunciated in 1975 by Feingold [Why Your Child Is Hyperactive. New York:Random House (1975)], who asserted that elevated sensitivity to food additives underlies the signs of hyperactivity observed in some children. Although the evidence suggested that some unknown proportion of children did respond to synthetic food colors, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) interpreted the evidence as inconclusive. A study published in 2007 [McCann et al. Food additives and hyperactive behaviour in 3-year-old and 8/9-year-old children in the community: a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Lancet 370:1560-1567 (2007)] drew renewed attention to the hypothesis because of the study's size and scope. It led the FDA to review the evidence, hold a public hearing, and seek the advice of its Food Advisory Committee. In preparation for the hearing, the FDA reviewed the available evidence and concluded that it did not warrant further agency action. OBJECTIVES: In this commentary I examine the basis of the FDA's position, the elements of the review that led to its decision and that of the Food Advisory Committee, and the reasons that this is an environmental health issue. DISCUSSION: The FDA review confined itself, in essence, to the clinical diagnosis of hyperactivity, as did the charge to the committee, rather than asking the broader environmental question of behavioral effects in the general population; it failed to recognize the significance of vulnerable subpopulations; and it misinterpreted the meaning of effect size as a criterion of risk. The FDA's response would have benefited from adopting the viewpoints and perspectives common to environmental health research. At the same time, the food color debate offers a lesson to environmental health researchers; namely, too narrow a focus on a single outcome or criterion can be misleading.},

Despite mounting attention to the problem of online misinformation and growing agreement that digital literacy efforts are important, prior research offers few concrete ideas about what skilled evaluations look like. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: Our purpose in this study was to seek out those who are skilled in online evaluations in order to understand how their strategies and approaches to evaluating digital content might inform educational efforts. We sampled 45 experienced users of the Internet: 10 Ph.D. historians, 10 professional fact checkers, and 25 Stanford University undergraduates. Analysis focused on the strategies participants used to evaluate online information and arrive at judgments of credibility. Research Design: In this expert/novice study, participants thought aloud as they evaluated live websites and searched for information on social and political issues such as bullying, minimum wage, and teacher tenure. We analyze and present findings from three of the tasks participants completed. Findings/Results: Historians and students often fell victim to easily manipulated features of websites, such as official-looking logos and domain names. They read vertically, staying within a website to evaluate its reliability. In contrast, fact checkers read laterally, leaving a site after a quick scan and opening up new browser tabs in order to judge the credibility of the original site. Compared to the other groups, fact checkers arrived at more warranted conclusions in a fraction of the time. Conclusions/Recommendations: We draw on insights gleaned from the fact checkers' practices to examine current curricular approaches to teaching web credibility as well as to suggest alternatives.},

However, mHealth application services are mainly based on the collection of personal and behavioral data, which conflicts with users’ growing privacy concerns. In that context, this study considers the privacy paradox phenomenon, in which privacy concerns co-exist with disclosure behavior. This study explores the privacy paradox in mHealth applications using an integrated elaboration likelihood model (ELM) from the perspective of privacy calculus and privacy fatigue. Results from the quasi-experiment and partial least squares structural equation modeling reveal that, compared with privacy concerns, perceived benefits have a greater impact on users’ disclosure intention, which further supports the existence of the privacy paradox in the mHealth context; this process is found to originate in users’ privacy calculus. However, privacy fatigue is found to have an insignificant impact on users’ disclosure intention, which may be due to the low sunk cost of users’ investment in mHealth applications. The results indicate that designers of mHealth applications should optimize their interaction functions to enhance benefits to users.},

  abstract = {Scientists hypothesized that drugs such as ibuprofen or renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers could exacerbate the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 by upregulating the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which serves as an entry receptor for the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. This hypothesis was taken up by the lay press and led to concerns among doctors and patients whether the use of these drugs was still safe and justified against the background of the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2 with an increasing number of cases and deaths. In this article, we summarize what is known about the effect of RAS blockers or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on the course of COVID-19 disease. In the case of RAS inhibition, we also find evidence for the opposite hypothesis, namely, that RAS inhibition in COVID-19 could be protective. In view of the inconsistent and limited evidence and after weighing up the benefits and risks, we would not currently recommend discontinuing or switching an effective treatment with RAS blockers. NSAIDs should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible period. The choice of drug to treat COVID-19-associated fever or pain should be based on a benefit-risk assessment for known side effects (e.g., kidney damage, gastrointestinal ulceration).},
