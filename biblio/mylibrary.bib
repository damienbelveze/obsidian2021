  abstract = {Critical thinking (CT) is purposeful, self-regulatory judgment that results in interpretation, analysis, evaluation, and inference, as well as explanations of the considerations on which that judgment is based. This article summarizes the available empirical evidence on the impact of instruction on the development and enhancement of critical thinking skills and dispositions and student achievement. The review includes 341 effects sizes drawn from quasi- or true-experimental studies that used standardized measures of CT as outcome variables. The weighted random effects mean effect size (g+) was 0.30 (p {$<$} .001). The collection was heterogeneous (p {$<$} .001). Results demonstrate that there are effective strategies for teaching CT skills, both generic and content specific, and CT dispositions, at all educational levels and across all disciplinary areas. Notably, the opportunity for dialogue, the exposure of students to authentic or situated problems and examples, and mentoring had positive effects on CT skills.},

  date = {2020},
  abstract = {While celebrity messaging is thought to be important in the design of public health campaigns, there is little work (a) decomposing the extent to which celebrity endorsement relies on directly authoring the content as opposed to passing on messages of others, (b) measuring how much explicitly citing public health authorities matters, and (c) examining whether these online messages are meaningfully received and digested offline. We address these three questions by conducting a large-scale randomized trial in Indonesia in 2015-2016, in which 46 high profile celebrities agreed to tweet or retweet messages promoting immunization. The decomposition shows that public health messages are 72\% more likely to be passed on when a celebrity is involved, but importantly, almost all of the effect (79\%) comes only when the celebrity authors the message themselves. Explicitly citing an external medical authority reduces the passing-on rate by 27\%. The results suggest that celebrities have an outsize influence in shaping public opinion on public health, particularly when they speak in their own voice.},

Traits measured were number of eggs collected, egg weight, amount of feed taken from the feed troughs, body weight gain, fertility of eggs, feather pecking and comb damage scores, leukocyte count, plasma corticosterone level, and adrenal gland weight. During the 2-month experimental period, blind hens produced 12.7\% more eggs (hen-day production) while requiring 44.1 g less feed per bird per day compared to sighted hens. There was no significant difference in body weight gained between the two genotypes. Significant genotype × flock size and genotype × density interactions also indicated that the performance of the blind chickens was less affected by differences in density and flock size compared with sighted chickens. Other traits measured provided evidence that the blind chickens were less active, had better feather coverage, and were perhaps under less stress than sighted ones.},

  abstract = {Following the 2016 US presidential election, many have expressed concern about the effects of false stories (“fake news”), circulated largely through social media. We discuss the economics of fake news and present new data on its consumption prior to the election. Drawing on web browsing data, archives of fact-checking websites, and results from a new online survey, we find: 1) social media was an important but not dominant source of election news, with 14 percent of Americans calling social media their “most important” source; 2) of the known false news stories that appeared in the three months before the election, those favoring Trump were shared a total of 30 million times on Facebook, while those favoring Clinton were shared 8 million times; 3) the average American adult saw on the order of one or perhaps several fake news stories in the months around the election, with just over half of those who recalled seeing them believing them; and 4) people are much more likely to believe stories that favor their preferred candidate, especially if they have ideologically segregated social media networks.},

  abstract = {Alarmist narratives about online misinformation continue to gain traction despite evidence that its prevalence and impact are overstated. Drawing on research questioning the use of big data in social science and reception studies, we identify six misconceptions about misinformation and examine the conceptual and methodological challenges they raise. The first three misconceptions concern the prevalence and circulation of misinformation. First, the internet is not rife with misinformation or news, but with memes and entertaining content. Second, scientists focused on social media because it is methodologically convenient, but misinformation is not just a social media problem. Third, falsehoods don’t spread faster than the truth, how we define (mis)information influences our results and their practical implications. The second three misconceptions concern the impact and the reception of misinformation. First, people don’t believe everything they see on the internet: sheer volume of engagement should not be conflated with belief. Second, misinformation’s influence on people’s behavior is overblown since it often preaches to the choir. Third, people are more likely to be uninformed than misinformed, surveys overestimate misperceptions and say little about the causal influence of misinformation. To appropriately understand and fight misinformation, future research needs to address these challenges.},

Avant tout outil d’aide à la gestion des données d’un projet de recherche et à la définition de bonnes pratiques, il s’agit également d’un livrable à usage externe, dont la rédaction est exigée par de nombreux financeurs de la recherche. L’ANR (depuis 2019) et la Commission européenne (depuis 2014), entre autres, exigent des chercheurs qui soumettent une demande de financement qu’ils fournissent un plan de gestion détaillé des données de recherche qu’ils comptent utiliser. Ce document témoigne de la bonne gestion des données au cours du projet et il permet de déterminer quelles données de recherche pourront être mises à la disposition du plus grand nombre, dans un souci de transparence scientifique et de partage des savoirs. Mais à quoi ressemble exactement un PGD ? Quelles sont les informations indispensables à y inscrire ? Existe-t-il des modèles ? Comment inscrire ce travail chronophage dans un projet de recherche et le valoriser ? Est-ce vraiment bien utile ? \#\#\# Objectifs Cette formation vise à présenter en détails le concept de « plan de gestion des données » et à expliciter en quoi ce document, qui peut apparaître à première vue comme un fardeau administratif supplémentaire, peut en réalité apporter de nouvelles pistes de réflexion dans la recherche. L’objectif de cette journée est de permettant aux producteurs de données de s’interroger sur les bonnes pratiques à adopter à toutes les étapes de leur projet, qu’il s’agisse d’un projet financé ou d’une thèse de doctorat. La formation sera également l’occasion de découvrir les nombreuses ressources et outils qui sont à la disposition des doctorants et des chercheurs pour faciliter leur rédaction, ainsi que les options qui s’offrent à eux pour valoriser ce travail.~ À l’issue de la formation, le stagiaire sera capable de : 1.~~ ~Donner une définition de ce qu’est un plan de gestion des données 2.~~ ~Citer les questions auxquelles doit répondre un PGD 3.~~ ~Discerner les cas dans lesquels la rédaction d’un PGD est obligatoire de ceux dans lesquels il n’est qu’utile 4.~~ ~Comprendre en quoi la rédaction d’un PGD participe du mouvement de la science ouverte (open science) 5.~~ ~Utiliser l’outil DMP-OPIDoR pour rédiger un plan de gestion des données 6.~~ ~Connaître les critères selon lesquels la Commission européenne évalue un PGD, et auto-évaluer son propre PGD 7.~~ ~Donner une définition de ce que sont un data paper et un data journal, et savoir où trouver de telles ressources \#\# PROGRAMME 1.~~ ~Quelques rappels sur les données de la recherche 2.~~ ~Le PGD en théorie : définition et modèles 3.~~ ~Le PGD en pratique : guide de rédaction et étude de plans rédigés 4.~~ ~Le PGD en pratique : un retour d’expérience de rédaction 5.~~ ~Boîte à outils : prise en main de DMP OPIDoR 6.~~ ~Valoriser son PGD : introduction aux data papers \#\# PRÉ-REQUIS Savoir utiliser un navigateur web.

This article summarizes the history of this controversial topic and testimony to the 2011 Food and Drug Administration Food Advisory Committee convened to evaluate the current status of evidence regarding attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Features of ADHD relevant to understanding the AFC literature are explained: ADHD is a quantitative diagnosis, like hypertension, and some individuals near the threshold may be pushed over it by a small symptom increment. The chronicity and pervasiveness make caregiver ratings the most valid measure, albeit subjective. Flaws in many studies include nonstandardized diagnosis, questionable sample selection, imperfect blinding, and nonstandardized outcome measures. Recent data suggest a small but significant deleterious effect of AFCs on children's behavior that is not confined to those with diagnosable ADHD. AFCs appear to be more of a public health problem than an ADHD problem. AFCs are not a major cause of ADHD per se, but seem to affect children regardless of whether or not they have ADHD, and they may have an aggregated effect on classroom climate if most children in the class suffer a small behavioral decrement with additive or synergistic effects. Possible biological mechanisms with published evidence include the effects on nutrient levels, genetic vulnerability, and changes in electroencephalographic beta-band power. A table clarifying the Food and Drug Administration and international naming systems for AFCs, with cross-referencing, is provided.},

  abstract = {Pourquoi les théories complotistes séduisent-elles autant ? Collègues, amis, parents... Les discours conspirationnistes progressent dans tous les milieux et entrent aujourd'hui dans notre sphère intime. Notre premier réflexe : contredire. Or cela ne fait que renforcer les croyances de notre interlocuteur. Mais qui peut se résigner à voir certains de ses proches basculer dans le complotisme ? Comment réagir sans rompre le fil du dialogue ? Cela passe par l'écoute. Une gageure, tant la discussion est viciée, mais c'est à la portée de chacun. La preuve : William Audureau, journaliste au Monde, média honni des complotistes, a réussi à gagner la confiance de stars et d'anonymes de la complosphère pour nouer avec eux un dialogue au long cours. Antivax, « spécialistes » du 11-Septembre et des sociétés secrètes, adeptes de la naturopathie en lutte contre Big Pharma ou sympathisants du mouvement QAnon : ils lui ont tous parlé à coeur ouvert. Le résultat est une plongée fascinante au coeur de la mécanique de pensée conspirationniste et de son pouvoir d'attraction. Riche de portraits éclairants et nourri d'analyses des meilleurs spécialistes, ce livre dévoile les nombreux chemins qui mènent au complotisme. Et ceux qui permettent d'en sortir.

This study assesses the percentage of grocery store products marketed to children that contain AFCs, by category and company.

The most common AFCs were Red 40 (29.8\% of products), Blue 1 (24.2\%), Yellow 5 (20.5\%), and Yellow 6 (19.5\%). Produce was the only category that did not have any AFCs. The highest percentage of products with AFCs was found in candies (96.3\%), fruit-flavored snacks (94\%), and drink mixes/powders (89.7\%). Forty-one of the 66 companies marketed products containing AFCs. Given concerns about health effects of AFCs and high proportions of high-AFC categories, clinicians, parents, food companies, and the government can take steps to support children's healthy eating and development by reducing AFCs in children's diets.},

To cultivate critical thinkers, librarians continue to build innovative practices, even as technology rapidly evolves. However, the pervasiveness of misinformation and disinformation, most recently seen in the conspiratorial worldviews of QAnon, challenges librarians to center critical thinking in their information literacy praxis. In this article, we provide a concise overview of QAnon and the problems that contemporary internet conspiracy theories like it pose. We offer an epistemological shift for information literacy, from heuristics to mindsets and behaviors, drawing on disciplines external to librarianship. Finally, we consider the role that emotions play in the promotion and spread of conspiracism. Equipping librarians with a better understanding of conspiracy thinking and the tools to counter it will in turn empower the next generation of critical thinkers.},

Dans la profusion de textes écrits après novembre 2016, tous s’accordent sur l'idée que les fake news sont un «~mal du siècle~» contre lequel les bibliothécaires ont vocation à s'engager. Sur ce point, si la question des moyens se pose, ce n’est pas le cas de la légitimité en tant que bibliothécaire à intervenir dans ce champ. Comment, en effet, ne pas voir des deux côtés de l’Atlantique la question des fake news comme un prolongement de celle de «~l’évaluation de l’information~» qui apparaît depuis les années~90 dans le corpus des enseignements délivrés par les formateurs en bibliothèque. Le sésame «~fake news~» permet donc de donner un nouveau lustre à ces apprentissages, même si l'objet a un peu changé au passage. À l'origine, en effet, les efforts se focalisaient sur la notion d’autorité et la spécificité du texte scientifique –~ou comment permettre aux étudiants de mieux le distinguer d'une information vulgarisée. Dans un premier temps, il a fallu persuader l'université que la légitimité fondée sur une abondance de sources valides pouvait valoir celle d'un auteur reconnu dans sa discipline. Restaurer l’image de Wikipédia en l’abordant dans nos cours est assurément u},

  abstract = {Despite the scientific consensus about the anthropogenic nature of climate change, there are still obstacles hindering society from acknowledging the severity of the situation. Notably, previous research suggests that climate change threats can cause people to display ethnocentric reaction to preserve the ingroup’s interests. In this research, we investigate the relation between collective narcissism and attitudes towards climate science. We argue that national collective narcissism is negatively associated with the acceptance of climate science. We further hypothesized that this relation might be mediated by conspiracy beliefs about climate change, because narcissistic identifiers are prone to hold conspiracy beliefs. In a pilot Study (N = 409), we found that national collective narcissism was significantly associated with climate change conspiracy beliefs. In Study 1 (N = 295), climate change conspiracy beliefs mediated the negative relation between national collective narcissism and acceptance of climate science. In Study 2 (N = 375), this mediation was replicated when controlling for other forms of climate skepticism. Lastly, general conspiracy mentality did not mediate this relation, which emphasizes the importance of considering the specificity of climate change conspiracy theories (rather than generic propensity to believe in conspiracy theories) in understanding distrust toward climate science.},

  abstract = {« Nous étouffons parmi des gens qui pensent avoir absolument raison », disait Albert Camus, et nous sommes nombreux à ressentir la même chose aujourd’hui, tant l’air devient proprement irrespirable. Les réseaux sociaux sont un théâtre d’ombres où le débat est souvent remplacé par l’invective : chacun, craignant d’y rencontrer un contradicteur, préfère traquer cent ennemis. Au-delà même de Twitter ou de Facebook, le champ intellectuel et politique se confond avec un champ de bataille où tous les coups sont permis. Partout de féroces prêcheurs préfèrent attiser les haines plutôt qu’éclairer les esprits.Avec ce livre, Jean Birnbaum veut apporter du réconfort à toutes les femmes, tous les hommes qui refusent la «brutalisation» de notre débat public et qui veulent préserver l’espace d’une discussion aussi franche qu’argumentée. Pour cela, il relit les textes de quelques intellectuels et écrivains qui ne se sont jamais contentés d’opposer l’idéologie à l’idéologie, les slogans aux slogans. Renouer avec Albert Camus, George Orwell, Hannah Arendt, Raymond Aron, Georges Bernanos, Germaine Tillion ou encore Roland Barthes, ce n’est pas seulement trouver refuge auprès de figures aimées, qui permettent de tenir bon, de se tenir bien. C’est surtout retrouver l’espoir et la capacité de proclamer ceci : dans le brouhaha des évidences, il n’y a pas plus radical que la nuance.},

Le ministère de l'Enseignement supérieur, de la Recherche et de l'Innovation y consacrera jusqu'à 3 millions d'euros afin de lui permettre de réaliser ses missions. Le Plan national pour la science ouverte annoncé par Frédérique Vidal, le 4 juillet 2018, rend obligatoire l'accès ouvert pour les données issues de recherches financées sur projets. Conformément aux dispositions de la loi du 7 octobre 2016 pour une République numérique, ces données devront être publiées dans un format numérique, ouvert et réutilisable. En application de l’article L311-9 du Code des relations entre le public et l'administration (CRPA), je souhaite obtenir la  publication des informations en ligne.

The purpose of this  study was to determine the link between anxiety and executive functions through  quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) based on the RDoC system.  Nineteen-channel EEGs were recorded at the psychiatric clinic from 41 patients with  symptoms of anxiety. The EEG power spectra were analysed. The Executive Intelligence  Test (EXIT) including the K-WAIS-IV, Stroop, controlled oral word association, and  the design fluency tests were performed. A partial, inversed, and significant  association was observed between executive intelligence quotient (EIQ) and the  absolute delta power in the central region. Similarly, a partial, inversed, and  significant association was observed between design fluency and the absolute delta  power in the left parietal area. Our findings suggest that the increase in delta  power in the central region and left P3 was negatively correlated with the decrease  in executive function. It is expected that the absolute delta power plays a specific  role in the task-negative default mode network in the relationship between anxiety  and executive function.},

From social media to academia, public speech to casual conversation, the word is utilized to brand people of all kinds with a term once reserved exclusively for those who came from wealth and old money―inherited advantage.Today “privileged” applies to anyone who enjoys an unearned advantage in life, inherited or not. White privilege, male privilege, straight privilege―those conditions make everyday life easier, less stressful, more lucrative, and generally better for those who hold one, two, or all three designations. But what about white female privilege in the context of feminism? Or fixed gender privilege in the context of transgender? Or weight and height privilege in the context of hiring practices and salary levels? Or food privilege in the context of widening inequality for single-parent families?In The Perils of “Privilege,” Phoebe Maltz Bovy examines the rise of this word into extraordinary potency. Does calling out privilege help to change or soften it? Or simply reinforce it by dividing people against themselves? And is privilege a concept that, in fact, only privileged people are debating? The Perils of “Privilege” explores how this word is deployed, and offers ways to begin anew so many of the conversations it has silenced.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Whale carcasses, sunken wood, and cold seeps provide organically enriched oases in the food-limited deep-sea benthos. At three such enriched habitats in Monterey Bay, CA, at a depth of nearly 3000 m, we observed pycnogonids (sea spiders) of at least two species, Colossendeis gigas and C. japonica, feeding on sea anemones that were commonly found there. Submersible remotely operated vehicles provided direct observations of feeding, as well as high definition video and photographic images. We recorded the co-occurrence of both pycnogonids and prey anemones during ten of 12 visits during 2002–2006. Anemones and pycnogonids were conspicuously more abundant at these oases than in the surrounding benthos. The sedentary anemone Anthosactis pearseae was attached directly to whalebones while the pom-pom anemone, Liponema brevicornis, was found resting on soft sediment, rolling in benthic currents, or accumulating where these currents were disrupted by topography, as at whale falls, wood falls, and clam fields. Both pycnogonid species were observed feeding on these anemones, either as predators or as micropredators.},

  abstract = {A major factor underlying several of scholarship's most pressing problems is its antiquated journal system with its trifecta of reproducibility, affordability and functionality crises. Any solution needs to not only solve the current problems but also be capable of preventing a takeover by corporations. Technically, there is broad agreement on the goal for a modern scholarly digital infrastructure: it needs to replace traditional journals with a decentralized, resilient, evolvable network that is interconnected by open standards under the governance of the scholarly community. It needs to replace the monopolies of current journals with a genuine, functioning and well-regulated market. In this new market, substitutable service providers compete and innovate according to the conditions of the scholarly community, avoiding further vendor lock-in. Redirection of funding from the legacy publishers to the new framework may be realized by a tried-and-tested incentive system: Funding agencies have ensured minimum standards at funded institutions by requiring specific infrastructures. These requirements, updated to include the new framework, provide exquisite incentives for institutions to redirect their infrastructure funds from antiquated journals to modern technology. At the same time and enabled by this plan, new, modern and adaptable reputation systems, long demanded by the scientific community, can finally be implemented. Ownership involves socially recognized economic rights, first and foremost the exclusive control over that property, with the self-efficacy it affords. The inability to exert such control over crucial components of their scholarly infrastructure in the face of a generally recognized need for action for over three decades now, evinces the dramatic erosion of real ownership rights for the scholarly community over said infrastructure. Thus, this proposal is motivated not only by the now very urgent need to restore such ownership to the scholarly community, but also by the understanding that through their funding bodies, scholars may have an effective and proven avenue at their disposal to identify game-changing actions and to design a financial incentive structure for recipient institutions that can help realize the restoration of ownership, with the goal to implement open digital infrastructures that are as effective and as invisible as their non-digital counterparts.},

Multiple genes have been reported to be linked to monogenic PD but these only explain a fraction of the observed familial aggregation. Rare variants in RIC3 have been suggested to be associated with PD in the Indian population. However, replication studies yielded inconsistent results. We further investigate the role of RIC3 variants in PD in European cohorts using individual-level genotyping data from 14,671 PD patients and 17,667 controls, as well as whole-genome sequencing data from 1,615 patients and 961 controls. We also investigated RIC3 using summary statistics from a Latin American cohort of 1,481 individuals, and from a cohort of 31,575 individuals of East Asian ancestry. We did not identify any association between RIC3 and PD in any of the cohorts. However, more studies of rare variants in non-European ancestry populations, in particular South Asian populations, are necessary to further evaluate the world-wide role of RIC3 in PD etiology.},

These studies show that interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 and the stress hormone corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), present in IBS plasma, have functional effects on gastrointestinal activity by stimulating myenteric neurons and colonic contractions. Moreover, in the Wistar Kyoto rat model of IBS, which exhibits altered gastrointestinal motility and visceral pain sensitivity, blocking IL-6 and/or CRF1 receptors alleviates these IBS-like symptoms. Underlying these effects are altered colonic protein expression of tight junction proteins which regulate gut barrier function and the T-type calcium channel Ca(V)3.2, which has been linked to visceral pain. These findings demonstrate the importance of the enteric nervous system and intestinal physiology in bowel dysfunction. AbstractThe search for effective therapeutic strategies for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is hampered by an incomplete understanding of its underlying pathophysiology. Stress and altered plasma cytokine profiles indicative of immune activation are characteristic of the disorder. The neuromodulatory effects of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and corticotropin-releasing factor receptor (CRFR) 1 in visceral pain and stress-induced defecation in the Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rat model of IBS were investigated. Sprague Dawley and WKY rats were administered anti-IL-6 receptor antibodies (xIL-6R, 0.5mgkg(-1) i.p) with or without the CRFR1 antagonist antalarmin (10mgkg(-1) i.p). Post-intervention, the pain threshold to colorectal distension and stress-induced faecal output were compared and changes in colonic mucosal protein expression were investigated. The neuro-stimulatory effects of IBS plasma on the myenteric plexus is mediated by IL-6, IL-8 and CRF. The stimulatory effects of these soluble factors on myenteric neuron excitability and colonic contractility were additive. Moreover, inhibition of IL-6 and CRF1 receptors in vivo in the WKY IBS rat model normalized stress-induced defecation (P{$<$}0.01) and visceral pain sensitivity (P{$<$}0.001) with associated changes in protein expression of the tight junction proteins occludin and claudin 2, the visceral pain-associated T-type calcium channel Ca(V)3.2 and intracellular signalling molecules STAT3, SOCS3 and ERK1/2. These studies demonstrate the additive effects of immune and stress factors on myenteric neuronal excitability. Moreover, combined targeting of peripheral IL-6 and CRF1 receptors is effective in alleviating IBS-like symptoms in the WKY rat. Thus, crosstalk between stress and immune factors during IBS flares may underlie symptom exacerbation.},

Post-intervention, the pain threshold to colorectal distension and stress-induced faecal output were compared and changes in colonic mucosal protein expression were investigated. The neuro-stimulatory effects of IBS plasma on the myenteric plexus is mediated by IL-6, IL-8 and CRF. The stimulatory effects of these soluble factors on myenteric neuron excitability and colonic contractility were additive. Moreover, inhibition of IL-6 and CRF1 receptors in vivo in the WKY IBS rat model normalized stress-induced defecation (P{$<$}0.01) and visceral pain sensitivity (P{$<$}0.001) with associated changes in protein expression of the tight junction proteins occludin and claudin 2, the visceral pain-associated T-type calcium channel Ca(V)3.2 and intracellular signalling molecules STAT3, SOCS3 and ERK1/2. These studies demonstrate the additive effects of immune and stress factors on myenteric neuronal excitability. Moreover, combined targeting of peripheral IL-6 and CRF1 receptors is effective in alleviating IBS-like symptoms in the WKY rat. Thus, crosstalk between stress and immune factors during IBS flares may underlie symptom exacerbation.},

  abstract = {In recent decades, changing lifestyles in Canadian homes has led to demand for foods with long shelf lives that are cosmetically appealing, palatable, easy to prepare and to consume. Food additives, especially preservatives and artificial colours as well as suboptimal intake of essential nutrients, have been linked to hyperactive behaviours and poor attention in a subgroup of children. Although other risk factors (ie, genetic, etc) for these conditions have received more attention in the scientific literature, the authors believe that there is enough evidence to consider dietary influences as a modifiable risk factor. This would involve raising awareness among clinicians and, subsequently, reviewing food regulatory processes to better protect children in Canada - similar to the regulations recently undertaken by the British Food Standards Agency. Conflicts of interest due to food and medication industry support for organizations advocating for children would need to be resolved by open communication between government regulatory agencies, academia and industry. Canadian parents and children need to be advised to limit unnecessary food additives and consume a diet rich in essential nutrients while more complete relationships are being explored further.},

Il suffirait d'écouter les experts pour devenir heureux. L'industrie du bonheur, qui brasse des millions d'euros, affirme ainsi pouvoir façonner les individus en créatures capables de faire obstruction aux sentiments négatifs, de tirer le meilleur parti d'elles-mêmes en contrôlant totalement leurs désirs improductifs et leurs pensées défaitistes. Mais n'aurions-nous pas affaire ici à une autre ruse destinée à nous convaincre, encore une fois, que la richesse et la pauvreté, le succès et l'échec, la santé et la maladie sont de notre seule responsabilité ? Et si la dite science du bonheur visait à nous convertir à un modèle individualiste niant toute idée de société ? Edgar Cabanas et Eva Illouz reconstituent ici avec brio les origines de cette nouvelle " science " et explorent les implications d'un phénomène parmi les plus captivants et inquiétants de ce début de siècle (4e de couverture)},

  abstract = {La crise des médias et la défiance des citoyens envers l'information grandissent chaque jour et notre conviction est que cette situation n’a rien d’inéluctable. La confiance peut être regagnée en traitant le problème à la racine : la propriété des médias. Comment les citoyens peuvent-ils accorder leur confiance aux médias si aucune règle claire n’empêche un actionnaire d’interférer dans le fonctionnement des rédactions ou de faire licencier un journaliste qui lui déplaît ? Doit-on se satisfaire d'une situation dans laquelle une poignée d'industriels possèdent la quasi-totalité des médias, limitant le pluralisme d’opinions et appauvrissant d’autant le débat public ? Est-il acceptable que les journalistes ne soient pas consultés lorsque leur titre est vendu à tel ou tel « mécène » ? Il n’existe pas de fatalité à ce que les médias se vident de leurs journalistes au fil de leurs rachats successifs par des industriels. L’information est un bien public dont la production doit être confiée à des journalistes disposant d’une véritable indépendance éditoriale, et nous pensons que cette indépendance est possible en adoptant de nouvelles règles. Ce livre vise à armer les citoyens, les journalistes et les régulateurs en faisant toute la lumière sur les différentes formes de propriété des médias et les limites des régulations existantes. Il ne s’agit pas de questions techniques, mais des fondamentaux d’un débat démocratique éclairé. Pour cela, nous proposons une loi de démocratisation de l'information permettant aux journalistes et aux citoyens de reprendre enfin le contrôle des médias. Des médias indépendants gouvernés de manière démocratique et tournés vers la production d’une information de qualité. Rejoignez-nous dans ce combat ! (éditeur)},

  abstract = {Exposure to artificial food colors and additives (AFCAs) has been implicated in the induction and severity of some childhood behavioral and learning disabilities. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nACHRs) are thought to be effective in the learning and memory-generating process. In this study, we investigated the effects of intrauterine exposure to AFCAs on subunit concentrations of NMDARs and nAChRs isoforms in rats. We administered a mixture of AFCAs (Eritrosin, Ponceau 4R, Allura Red AC, Sunset Yellow FCF, Tartrazin, Amaranth, Brilliant Blue, Azoruhin and Indigotin) to female rats before and during gestation. The concentration of NR2A and NR2B subunits and nAChR alpha 7, alpha 4 beta 2 isoforms in their offspring's hippocampi were measured by Western Blotting. Expressions of NR2B and nAChR beta 2 were significantly increased (17\% and 6.70\%, respectively), whereas expression of nAChR alpha 4 was significantly decreased (5.67\%) in male experimental group compared to the male control group (p {$<$} 0.05). In the female experimental group, AFCAs caused a 14\% decrease in NR2B expression when compared to the female control group (p {$<$} 0.05). Our results indicate that exposure to AFCAs during the fetal period may lead to alterations in expressions of NMDARs and nAChRs in adulthood. These alterations were different between male and female genders. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Exposure to artificial food colors and additives (AFCAs) has been implicated in the induction and severity of some childhood behavioral and learning disabilities. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nACHRs) are thought to be effective in the learning and memory-generating process. In this study, we investigated the effects of intrauterine exposure to AFCAs on subunit concentrations of NMDARs and nAChRs isoforms in rats. We administered a mixture of AFCAs (Eritrosin, Ponceau 4R, Allura Red AC, Sunset Yellow FCF, Tartrazin, Amaranth, Brilliant Blue, Azoruhin and Indigotin) to female rats before and during gestation. The concentration of NR2A and NR2B subunits and nAChR alpha 7, alpha 4 beta 2 isoforms in their offspring's hippocampi were measured by Western Blotting. Expressions of NR2B and nAChR beta 2 were significantly increased (17\% and 6.70\%, respectively), whereas expression of nAChR alpha 4 was significantly decreased (5.67\%) in male experimental group compared to the male control group (p {$<$} 0.05). In the female experimental group, AFCAs caused a 14\% decrease in NR2B expression when compared to the female control group (p {$<$} 0.05). Our results indicate that exposure to AFCAs during the fetal period may lead to alterations in expressions of NMDARs and nAChRs in adulthood. These alterations were different between male and female genders. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Seven US FDA-batch certified synthetic food colors are approved for use as food additives in the United States. Perceived neurodevelopmental concerns for these colors persist. This study assessed the plausibility of such an association through the evaluation of mechanistic evidence collected from in vitro assays or other alternative models. Mechanisms and molecular targets underlying neurodevelopmental processes associated with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other neurodevelopmental-related symptoms (e.g., cognitive function, learning and memory disorder, etc.) were identified. Publicly available data from the ToxCast/Tox21 high-throughput screening (HTS) program and peer-reviewed literature that measure activity of the colors for such molecular targets were analyzed and reviewed. Erythrosine (Red No. 3) was active in several assays mapped to neurodevelopmental processes - specifically, HTS assays that measure signals in neurotransmitter pathways. The remaining six colors do not appear to alter signaling pathways related to neurodevelopmental processes on the molecular or cellular level. This assessment provides an approach for systematically identifying and mapping mechanistic data to putative neurodevelopmental processes as a means to prioritize substances for possible further investigation. The assessment also provides insights into the lack of activity of synthetic food colors for key events in neurodevelopmental signaling pathways.},

The cutoff point for EOD and LOD was the first depressive  episode before age 60 or later. However, depressive symptoms at the time of disorder  are important confounders. The study aimed to compare cognitive function in older  people with EOD and LOD in the euthymic state. A sample of 135 participants aged 60+  with a history of major depressive disorder in remission, received  neuropsychological evaluation including tests of memory, attention, processing  speed, visuospatial function, language, and executive function. Individual test  scores and a derived composite score were investigated as dependent variables  against age of onset using multiple linear regressions adjusted for potential  confounders, including residual depressive symptoms. We found EOD (N~=~67) and LOD  (N~=~68) groups did not differ significantly in overall composite cognitive scores  after adjustment. Of individual test scores, only those for immediate recall were  significantly lower in participants with EOD compared to LOD. In conclusion, the  study found no associations between cognitive function and age of onset in this  sample of people with depressive disorder in remission. Active or residual  depressive symptoms might have confounded this relationship in previous research.},

In order to better understand the effects of deficit irrigation on tomato yield and fruit quality, four years of deficit irrigation experiments were investigated to simulate water-yield and water-fruit quality relationships of tomato in greenhouses. The yield and fruit quality parameters like total soluble solids (TSS), reducing sugars (RS), organic acids (OA), sugar/acid content ratio (SAR), vitamin C (VC), firmness (Fn), color index (CI) were correlated with seasonal evapotranspiration (ET) and ET deficit at flowering and fruit development stage (Stage II) and fruit ripening stage (Stage III) using linear regression. Three water-yield models (Jensen, Stewart, Minhas) and three water-fruit quality models (multiplicative, additive, exponential) were applied to simulate the relationships of tomato yield and fruit quality parameters with water deficit at various growth stages. The water deficit sensitivity indexes (lambda/Ky/delta or gamma/Kq/psi) of the models were calculated with the method of multiply linear regression. The performance and sensitivity analysis of the models were evaluated. Results showed that the relative yield decreased linearly with the drop of relative seasonal ET, mainly due to the yield depression by ET deficit at Stage Hand Stage III; the relative values of fruit quality parameters increased with the drop of relative seasonal ET, mostly because of the enhancement by ET deficit at Stage III. The calculated water deficit sensitivity indexes indicated that both the yield and fruit quality were hardly sensitive to water deficit at Stage I, but sensitive to water deficit at Stage II and that at Stage III; TSS, RS, SAR and VC were much more sensitive to water deficit at Stage III than that at Stage II; RS, SAR and VC were more sensitive to water deficit than TSS, OA, Fn and CI. The Minhas model with its water deficit sensitivity indexes was recommended to simulate wateryield relations of greenhouse tomato in the study area; multiplicative model and additive model were, respectively, recommended to simulate the relationships of fruit quality parameters like TSS, RS, SAR, Fn and fruit quality parameters like OA, VC, CI with water deficit at various growth stages. The water-yield and water-fruit quality models would be helpful to optimally allocate irrigation water during the growth season, thus achieving efficient production of tomato in greenhouses in consideration of the compromise between tomato yield and fruit quality.

  abstract = {It is often argued that cost-sharing—charging a subsidized, positive price— for a health product is necessary to avoid wasting resources on those who will not use or do not need the product. We explore this argument through a field experiment in Kenya, in which we randomized the price at which prenatal clinics could sell long-lasting antimalarial insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) to pregnant women. We find no evidence that cost-sharing reduces wastage on those who will not use the product: women who received free ITNs are not less likely to use them than those who paid subsidized positive prices. We also find no evidence that costsharing induces selection of women who need the net more: those who pay higher prices appear no sicker than the average prenatal client in the area in terms of measured anemia (an important indicator of malaria). Cost-sharing does, however, considerably dampen demand. We find that uptake drops by sixty percentage points when the price of ITNs increases from zero to \$0.60 (i.e., from 100\% to 90\% subsidy), a price still \$0.15 below the price at which ITNs are currently sold to pregnant women in Kenya. We combine our estimates in a cost-effectiveness analysis of the impact of ITN prices on child mortality that incorporates both private and social returns to ITN usage. Overall, our results suggest that free distribution of ITNs could save many more lives than cost-sharing programs have achieved so far, and, given the large positive externality associated with widespread usage of ITNs, would likely do so at a lesser cost per life saved.}

  abstract = {Cognitive biases are systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment, and are often studied in psychology and behavioral economics. Although the reality of most of these biases is confirmed by reproducible research, there are often controversies about how to classify these biases or how to explain them. Some are effects of information-processing rules (i.e., mental shortcuts), called heuristics, that the brain uses to produce decisions or judgments. Biases have a variety of forms and appear as cognitive ("cold") bias, such as mental noise, or motivational ("hot") bias, such as when beliefs are distorted by wishful thinking. Both effects can be present at the same time.There are also controversies over some of these biases as to whether they count as useless or irrational, or whether they result in useful attitudes or behavior. For example, when getting to know others, people tend to ask leading questions which seem biased towards confirming their assumptions about the person. However, this kind of confirmation bias has also been argued to be an example of social skill: a way to establish a connection with the other person.Although this research overwhelmingly involves human subjects, some findings that demonstrate bias have been found in non-human animals as well. For example, loss aversion has been shown in monkeys and hyperbolic discounting has been observed in rats, pigeons, and monkeys.},

À travers une cartographie précise et référencée des débats idéologiques actuels, il montre comment l’extrême droite parvient à imposer ses haines et ses obsessions au cœur du débat public. L’ultraconservatisme progresse, au nom d’un peuple-nation supposé homogène, tandis que la frontière entre gauche et droite est remise en question. Contre les polarisations manichéennes, Philippe Corcuff propose une approche nuancée cherchant à redonner du souffle à une gauche d’émancipation. Dans cette époque traversée par des vents violents, c’est avant tout une boussole que nous tend Corcuff\,: comment y voir plus clair dans le brouillard confusionniste\,?" -- [4e de couverture]},

The goal of this study was to discern the ways undergraduate preservice social studies teachers with different climate change beliefs read and evaluated the reliability of four diverse Web sources about the complex socioscientific topic of climate change. Findings highlight clear alignment between most participants with climate change beliefs at either end of a beliefs continuum with less alignment for participants with climate change beliefs toward the middle of a continuum. Findings also point to the benefits of whole group deliberation to help participants more critically evaluate a Web source that opposed the scientific consensus about climate change. In an age of “alternative facts,” this study points to the importance of students and educators having opportunities to evaluate, discuss, and determine the credibility of a range of online sources.},

  abstract = {Background.{$\quad$} On 7 February 2020, French Health authorities were informed of a confirmed case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in an Englishman infected in Singapore who had recently stayed in a chalet in the French Alps. We conducted an investigation to identify secondary cases and interrupt transmission. Methods.{$\quad$} We defined as a confirmed case a person linked to the chalet with a positive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction sample for SARS-CoV-2. Results.{$\quad$} The index case stayed 4 days in the chalet with 10 English tourists and a family of 5 French residents; SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 5 individuals in France, 6 in England (including the index case), and 1 in Spain (overall attack rate in the chalet: 75\%). One pediatric case, with picornavirus and influenza A coinfection, visited 3 different schools while symptomatic. One case was asymptomatic, with similar viral load as that of a symptomatic case. Seven days after the first cases were diagnosed, 1 tertiary case was detected in a symptomatic patient with from the chalet a positive endotracheal aspirate; all previous and concurrent nasopharyngeal specimens were negative. Additionally, 172 contacts were monitored; all contacts tested for SARS-CoV-2 (N = 73) were negative. Conclusions.{$\quad$} The occurrence in this cluster of 1 asymptomatic case with similar viral load as a symptomatic patient suggests transmission potential of asymptomatic individuals. The fact that an infected child did not transmit the disease despite close interactions within schools suggests potential different transmission dynamics in children. Finally, the dissociation between upper and lower respiratory tract results underscores the need for close monitoring of the clinical evolution of suspected cases of coronavirus disease 2019.},

  abstract = {With WhatsApp’s adoption of the Signal Protocol as its default, end-to-end encryption by the masses happened almost overnight. Unlike iMessage, WhatsApp notifies users that encryption is enabled, explicitly informing users about improved privacy. This rare feature gives us an opportunity to study people’s understandings and perceptions of secure messaging pre- and post-mass messenger encryption (pre/post-MME). To study changes in perceptions, we compared the results of two mental models studies: one conducted in 2015 pre-MME and one in 2017 post-MME. Our primary finding is that users do not trust encryption as currently offered. When asked about encryption in the study, most stated that they had heard of encryption, but only a few understood the implications, even on a high level. Their consensus view was that no technical solution to stop skilled attackers from getting their data exists. Even with a major development, such as WhatsApp rolling out endto-end encryption, people still do not feel well protected by their technology. Surprisingly, despite WhatsApp’s end-to-end security info messages and the high media attention, the majority of the participants were not even aware of encryption. Most participants had an almost correct threat model, but don’t believe that there is a technical solution to stop knowledgeable attackers to read their messages. Using technology made them feel vulnerable.},

Selon le dictionnaire d'Oxford, qui en a fait son mot de l'année, le terme désignerait des « circonstances dans lesquelles les faits objectifs ont moins d'influence pour former l'opinion publique que l'appel à l'émotion et aux croyances personnelles ». Ce livre prend le parti de retourner à la source de cet état des lieux et l'identifie dans le concept de « bullshit » théorisé par le philosophe Harry Frankfurt en 1986. Ce qu'il a défini comme une « indifférence à l'égard de la vérité » distincte du mensonge s'avère en effet un outil conceptuel remarquablement efficace pour saisir comment l'opinion prétend l'emporter sur la vérité et pour comprendre le succès des impostures scientifiques et des « théories du complot ». L'ère de la~post-vérité est bien celle du bullshit institué à une échelle globale, et seule une compréhension fine de ce phénomène permettra d'engager la lutte qui se prépare. Heureusement, une telle science du bullshit est en fait déjà disponible, mais il restait à l'assembler en un seul volume accessible, utile et stimulant.},

The issue is highly relevant for Israel, a country that relies on the digital capabilities of its workers for its major technology industries and is also often a target of cyberwarfare and cybercrime attacks. The purpose of this study is to identify the determinants of cyber-safety behavior. We investigate the role of age, gender and education in the use of safety-related digital skills and antivirus software. Using a 2014 survey of a national sample of Internet users in Israel (N = 1850), we found that age, gender, education and quality of access are associated with the level of users’ digital security skills. In addition, these skills and the frequency of conducting financial activities online are the main determinants of antivirus behaviors. Our results expand the understanding of cyber-safety by showing that social and digital disparities are reproduced in the use of measures to prevent online threats, putting the digitally disadvantaged at greater risk of becoming victims of online threats.},

  abstract = {Background According to epidemiological studies, Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with probable REM sleep behavior disorder (pRBD) are more prone to develop impulse control disorders (ICDs), which is shown to be present in drug-naïve PD patients, and vice versa. Objectives To investigate white-matter integrity differences, with and without comorbid pRBD and ICDs. Methods 149 de-novo PD patients and 30 age- and gender-matched controls from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative were studied. PD subjects were categorized into four groups with and without these comorbidities. We investigated the white matter integrity differences between these groups. Results PDs with only ICDs manifested greater fractional anisotropy (FA) and lower mean diffusivity (MD) in ipsilateral cerebellar connections when compared to controls and to Parkinson's with both comorbid disorders. In contrast, significantly lower FA and higher MD in the ipsilateral fornix-stria-terminalis was observed in PDs with only pRBD compared to controls and to PDs without either comorbid disorder. Also, PDs with only pRBD manifested greater FA in contralateral putamen when compared to controls. Conclusions Our results suggest the presence of an underlying neural network in PDs with ICDs, particularly involving cerebellar connections, which makes the subjects susceptible to pRBD. Lower white-matter integrity in the fornix of PDs with only pRBD suggests a neuropathological pathway specific to sleep behavior disorder, independent of impulse control disorders. Greater white-matter integrity observed in PDs without comorbid ICDs, regardless of their comorbid pRBD status, might reflect compensatory mechanisms. Targeted therapies for this particular neuropathology may help prevent these comorbidities.},

  abstract = {There are different citation habits in the research fields that influence the obsolescence of the research literature. We analyze the distinctive obsolescence of research literature in disciplinary journals in eight scientific subfields based on cited references distribution, as a synchronous approach. We use both negative binomial (NB) and Poisson distributions to capture this obsolescence. The corpus being examined is published in 2019 and covers 22,559 papers citing 872,442 references. Moreover, three measures to analyze the tail of the distribution are proposed: (i) cited reference survival rate, (ii) cited reference mortality rate, and (iii) cited reference percentile. These measures are interesting because the tail of the distribution collects the behavior of the citations at the time when the document starts to get obsolete in the sense that it is little cited (used). As main conclusion, the differences observed in obsolescence are so important even between disciplinary journals in the same subfield, that it would be necessary to use some measure for the tail of the citation distribution, such as those proposed in this paper, when analyzing in an appropriate way the long time impact of a journal.},

  abstract = {Depression has been shown to negatively impact neurocognitive functions, particularly those governed by fronto-subcortical networks, such as executive  functions. Converging evidence suggests that depression-related executive  dysfunction is greater at older ages, however, this has not been previously  confirmed by meta-analysis. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis,  using three-level models, on peer-reviewed studies that examined depression-related  differences in cognitive control in healthy community-dwelling individuals of any  age. We focused on studies of cognitive control as defined by the National Institute  of Mental Health (NIMH) Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework, which centers on  goal-directed behavior, such as goal selection (updating, representations,  maintenance), response selection (inhibition or suppression), and performance  monitoring. In 16,806 participants aged 7 to 97 across 76 studies, both clinical  depression and subthreshold depressive symptoms were associated with cognitive  control deficits (Hedges' g = -0.31). This relationship was stronger in study  samples with an older mean age. Within studies with a mean age of 39 years or  higher, which represents the median age in our analyses, the relationship was  stronger in clinical compared to subthreshold depression and in individuals taking  antidepressant medication. These findings highlight the importance of clinicians  screening for cognitive control dysfunction in patients with depression,  particularly in later stages of adulthood.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to analyze how depression associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) affected gait variability in these patients using a  dual-task paradigm. Additionally, the dependency of the executive functions and the  impact of depression on gait variability were analyzed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three  subject groups were included: patients with PD, but no depression (PD-NonDep; 14  patients), patients with both PD and depression (PD-Dep; 16 patients) and healthy  controls (HC; 15 subjects). Gait was recorded using the wireless sensors. The  participants walked under four conditions: single-task, motor dual- task, cognitive  dual-task, and combined dual-task. Variability of stride length, stride duration,  and swing time was calculated and analyzed using the statistical methods. RESULTS:  Variability of stride duration and stride length were not significantly different  between PD-Dep and PD-NonDep patients. The linear mixed model showed that swing time  variability was statistically significantly higher in PD-Dep patients compared to  controls (p\,=\,0.001). Hamilton Disease Rating Scale scores were significantly  correlated with the swing time variability (p\,=\,0.01). Variability of all three  parameters of gait was significantly higher while performing combined or cognitive  task and this effect was more pronounced in PD-Dep group of patients. CONCLUSIONS:  Depression in PD was associated with swing time variability, and this effect was  more prominent while performing a dual-task. SIGNIFICANCE: Diagnosing and treating  depression might be important for gait improvement and fall reduction in PD  patients.},

The novel strain Pediococcus pentosaceus GS4 has been reported for probiotic, survivability in simulated gastrointestinal fluid, and antioxidative and biohydrogenation properties. Therefore, we hypothesize that this specific strain might be able to assuage the effect of azoxymethane (AOM)-induced toxicity in mice. Twenty-eight Swiss albino mice were divided into 4 groups and were studied for-32 weeks. Azoxymethane (10 mg/kg body weight) was administered intraperitoneally twice (Oth and 14th days), and probiotic GS4 (1.1 x 10(9) colony-forming unit/mL) was given orally for the respective groups. Mice who served as the normal control received only normal saline. GS4-intervened AOM-induced mice showed marked improvement at the histopathologic level, in the liver and kidney. Moreover, probiotic GS4 intervention in AOM-induced mice exhibited a significant reduction in the liver function biomarker when compared with the AOM-induced mice. Probiotic GS4 intervention reduced the intestinal structural deformities as evident from the elevated brush border membrane-associated disaccharidases (sucrase, lactase) and intestinal alkaline phosphatase activities, which were found disrupted by AOM intoxication. Fecal bacterial load was found to be reduced in AOM-induced mice which were subsequently replenished by the probiotic GS4 intervention as apparent from the enhanced fecal bacterial load. There were no adverse effects observed in the probiotic control group. Conclusively, novel probiotic strain GS4 exhibited safe and beneficial effects against the toxicity threats posed by AOM. Thus, GS4 could be considered as a potential food supplement/additive for therapeutic purposes in gastrointestinal disorders related to inflammation and cancer. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Five recent reviews have analyzed trials on the association between artificial food colors and ADHD; the 50 underlying studies and the reviews in aggregate were inconclusive. Recent work has shown human in vivo SULT1A inhibition leading to incremental catecholamines, and an inverted-U relationship between brain catecholamines and proper functioning of the prefrontal cortex where ADHD behavior can arise. METHOD: This study re-examined the same underlying trials for evidence that SULT1A inhibitors were in the placebos and other inactive foods, that these "inactive" materials were symptomatic, and that ADHD symptoms exhibited an inverted-U response to SULT1A inhibition. RESULTS: Nearly all the underlying diets, and many placebos and delivery vehicles, were found to contain SULT1A inhibitors. Eight publications provided evidence of ADHD symptoms caused by the "inactive" materials containing SULT1A inhibitors. Ten studies showed additional SULT1A inhibitors reducing the symptoms of some subjects. CONCLUSION: SULT1A inhibitors in foods, including natural substances and artificial food colors, have a role in ADHD that can both worsen or improve symptoms. Mechanistically, SULT1A enzymes normally deactivate catecholamines, especially dopamine formed in the intestines; SULT1A inhibition can influence brain catecholamines through the intermediary of plasma tyrosine levels, which are influenced by dopamine inhibition of intestinal tyrosine hydroxylase. Biochemical measurements focused on SULT1A activity and plasma tyrosine concentrations are proposed for future work.},

  abstract = {Impaired visual search is a hallmark of spatial neglect. When searching for an unique feature (e.g., color) neglect patients often show only slight visual field asymmetries. In contrast, when the target is defined by a combination of features (e.g., color and form) they exhibit a severe deficit of contralesional search. This finding suggests a selective impairment of the serial deployment of spatial attention. Here, we examined this deficit with a preview paradigm. Neglect patients searched for a target defined by the conjunction of shape and color, presented together with varying numbers of distracters. The presentation time was varied such that on some trials participants previewed the target together with same-shape/different-color distracters, for 300 or 600 ms prior to the appearance of additional different-shape/same-color distracters. On the remaining trials the target and all distracters were shown simultaneously. Healthy participants exhibited a serial search strategy only when all items were presented simultaneously, whereas in both preview conditions a pop-out effect was observed. Neglect patients showed a similar pattern when the target was presented in the right hemifield. In contrast, when searching for a target in the left hemifield they showed serial search in the no-preview condition, as well as with a preview of 300 ms, and partly even at 600 ms. A control experiment suggested that the failure to fully benefit from item preview was probably independent of accurate perception of time. Our results, when viewed in the context of existing literature, lead us to conclude that the visual search deficit in neglect reflects two additive factors: a biased representation of attentional priority in favor of ipsilesional information and exaggerated capture of attention by ipsilesional abrupt onsets.},

Si les projets financés ont des obligations, les porteurs de projets peuvent les anticiper dès la phase de montage de leur projet, lors de la rédaction de leur proposition détaillée. Cela leur permet d’améliorer la faisabilité de leur projet en identifiant des services supports et les moyens nécessaire pour mettre en œuvre une stratégie Science Ouverte ambitieuse. Anticiper ces aspects peut aussi faciliter les collaborations au sein des équipes et des consortiums pour que la Science Ouverte soit une opportunité plutôt qu’une contrainte.

Cette croyance est issue de la pensée économique dominante, qui semble avoir pris, dans l’Occident post-religieux, la place du sacré. Jusqu’à remplir toutes les fonctions d’une religion d’État. Son culte a pour principe divin le Marché, dont l’appétit n’est apaisé que par la croissance. Il a pour valeur cardinale la liberté d’entreprendre, pour idéal l’équilibre et pour credo l’infinitude du monde, condition à la satisfaction des dieux. Il a ses temples, ces Bourses où valsent les indices, reflets des humeurs divines. Il a ses rites de consommation ; il a son clergé – la finance – et ses archiprêtres – les banquiers centraux, seuls capables d’apaiser la colère des dieux. L’économie a acquis l’autorité dont était investie la religion. Elle ne s’attaque plus à l’astronomie et à la biologie, comme le christianisme avant elle, mais s’en prend à l’écologie et à toutes les sciences qui fixent des limites au Marché. Une fascinante enquête au cœur du système économique qui nous régit."},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a three-item "Cognitive Reflection Test" (CRT) as a simple measure of one type of cognitive ability—the ability or disposition to reflect on a question and resist reporting the first response that comes to mind. The author will show that CRT scores are predictive of the types of choices that feature prominently in tests of decision-making theories, like expected utility theory and prospect theory. Indeed, the relation is sometimes so strong that the preferences themselves effectively function as expressions of cognitive ability—an empirical fact begging for a theoretical explanation. The author examines the relation between CRT scores and two important decision-making characteristics: time preference and risk preference. The CRT scores are then compared with other measures of cognitive ability or cognitive "style." The CRT scores exhibit considerable difference between men and women and the article explores how this relates to sex differences in time and risk preferences. The final section addresses the interpretation of correlations between cognitive abilities and decision-making characteristics.},

After accessing raw data sets, we checked whether data were available in a way that enabled re-analysis.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Results{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Of 3556 analyzed articles, 3416 contained DAS. The most frequent DAS category (42\%) indicated that the datasets are available on reasonable request. Among 1792 manuscripts in which DAS indicated that authors are willing to share their data, 1670 (93\%) authors either did not respond or declined to share their data with us. Among 254 (14\%) of 1792 authors who responded to our query for data sharing, only 122 (6.8\%) provided the requested data.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Conclusion{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Even when authors indicate in their manuscript that they will share data upon request, the compliance rate is the same as for authors who do not provide DAS, suggesting that DAS may not be sufficient to ensure data sharing.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Sous couvert de faire la part entre science et militantisme, une offensive réactionnaire est menée ainsi contre les libertés académiques.

  abstract = {Many immunotherapies act by enhancing the ability of cytotoxic T cells to kill tumor cells. Killing depends on T cell recognition of antigens presented by class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I) proteins on tumor cells. In this study, we showed that medulloblastomas lacking the p53 tumor suppressor do not express surface MHC-I and are therefore resistant to immune rejection. Mechanistically, this is because p53 regulates expression of the peptide transporter Tap1 and the aminopeptidase Erap1, which are required for MHC-I trafficking to the cell surface. In vitro, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or lymphotoxin-β receptor agonist can rescue expression of Erap1, Tap1 and MHC-I on p53-mutant tumor cells. In vivo, low doses of TNF prolong survival and synergize with immune checkpoint inhibitors to promote tumor rejection. These studies identified p53 as a key regulator of immune evasion and suggest that TNF could be used to enhance sensitivity of tumors to immunotherapy.},

Dans cet ouvrage à la fois théorique et pratique, philosophes et chercheurs exposent les failles mentales qui rendent vulnérables aux erreurs de raisonnement, tandis que vidéastes, journalistes ou enseignants témoignent des actions menées pour développer l'hygiène mentale de leurs contemporains. Ensemble, ils imaginent les bonnes pratiques de l'autodéfense intellectuelle, afin de poser les jalons d'un enseignement de l'esprit critique plus que jamais nécessaire et qui, surtout, aura fait la preuve de son efficience (4e de couverture)},

  abstract = {Background: The purpose of this research was to study the effectiveness of the overall dietary intervention rather than a single nutrient on children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Methods: This is a randomized controlled trial conducted at a child psychiatry clinic in Iran. Participants were 106 children and adolescents with ADHD. One group received methylphenidate plus dietary recommendations, while the other group only received methylphenidate. ADHD DSM-IV checklist was used to assess inattentiveness and hyperactivity/impulsivity scores at baseline and at the end of the trial. Results: The results revealed no significant difference between the two groups regarding mean age, gender ratio, body mass index, baseline inattentiveness score, and baseline hyperactivity score. Linear regression analysis considering the covariant variables showed that the inattentive score at the end of the trial was significantly associated with the mean change of favorite diet scores. Conclusion: This is the first clinical trial examining the effect of overall dietary characteristics rather than a single nutrient on the children formally diagnosed with ADHD. According to the results, un-favorite diet had no effects on inattentive or hyperactivity/impulsivity score. Encouraging the children with ADHD to increase their intake of recommended diet markedly improves their attention.},

Using Hardin’s Tragedy of the Commons, we show that an improper opening and enlargement of the digital environment (Infosphere) is likely to produce a Tragedy of the Digital Commons (TDC). In the course of the analysis, we explain why Adar and Huberman’s previous use of Hardin’s Tragedy to interpret certain recent phenomena in the Infosphere (especially peer-to-peer communication) may not be entirely satisfactory. We then seek to provide an improved version of the TDC that avoids the possible shortcomings of their model. Next, we analyse some problems encountered by the application of classical ethics in the resolution of the TDC. In the conclusion, we outline the kind of work that will be required to develop an ethical approach that may bridge the digital divide but avoid the TDC.},

Publication of narrative overviews of the literature should be standardized to increase their objectivity. Background In the past decade numerous changes in research methodology pertaining to reviews of the literature have occurred. These changes necessitate authors of review articles to be familiar with current standards in the publication process. Methods Narrative overview of the literature synthesizing the findings of literature retrieved from searches of computerized databases, hand searches, and authoritative texts. Discussion An overview of the use of three types of reviews of the literature is presented. Step by step instructions for how to conduct and write a narrative overview utilizing a ‘best-evidence synthesis’ approach are discussed, starting with appropriate preparatory work and ending with how to create proper illustrations. Several resources for creating reviews of the literature are presented and a narrative overview critical appraisal worksheet is included. A bibliography of other useful reading is presented in an appendix. Conclusion Narrative overviews can be a valuable contribution to the literature if prepared properly. New and experienced authors wishing to write a narrative overview should find this article useful in constructing such a paper and carrying out the research process. It is hoped that this article will stimulate scholarly dialog amongst colleagues about this research design and other complex literature review methods.},

  abstract = {Is the world really falling apart? Is the ideal of progress obsolete? Cognitive scientist Steven Pinker urges us to step back from the gory headlines and prophecies of doom, which play to our psychological biases. Instead, follow the data. In seventy-five graphs, Pinker shows that life, health, prosperity, safety, peace, knowledge, and happiness are on the rise, not just in the West, but worldwide. This progress is not the result of some cosmic force. It is a gift of the Enlightenment: the conviction that reason and science can enhance human flourishing. Far from being a naïve hope, the Enlightenment, we now know, has worked. But more than ever, it needs a vigorous defense. The Enlightenment project swims against currents of human nature -- tribalism, authoritarianism, demonization, magical thinking -- which demagogues are all too willing to exploit. Many commentators, committed to political, religious, or romantic ideologies, fight a rearguard action against it. The result is a corrosive fatalism and a willingness to wreck the precious institutions of liberal democracy and global cooperation. Pinker makes the case for reason, science, and humanism: the ideals we need to confront our problems and continue our progress},

  abstract = {Nonpharmacological interventions targeting putative network mechanisms of major depressive disorder (MDD) may represent novel treatments. This mechanistic study  investigates how a video game-like intervention, designed to improve cognitive  control network (CCN) functioning by targeting multitasking, influences the CCN of  middle-aged and older adults with MDD. The sample consisted of 34 adults aged 45-75  with SCID-defined diagnosis of MDD, Hamilton depression rating scale scores ≥20, and  a deficit in cognitive control. Participants were instructed to play at home for  20-25\,min per day, at least 5 times per week, for 4 weeks. Evidence of target  engagement was defined a priori as {$>$}2/3 of participants showing CCN improvement. CCN  engagement was defined as a change in a Z score of ≥0.5 on functional magnetic  resonance imaging (fMRI) in activation and functional connectivity of the CCN during  task-based and resting-state fMRI, respectively. 74\% of participants showed a change  in activation of the CCN, and 72\% showed an increase in resting-state functional  connectivity. Sixty-eight percent demonstrated improved cognitive control function,  measured as either improvement on sustained attention or working memory performance  or reduced self-reported symptoms of apathy on the frontal systems behavioral scale  (FrsBe). Participants also reported a significant reduction in mood symptoms  measured by PHQ-9. A remotely deployed neuroscience-informed video game-like  intervention improves both CCN functions and mood in middle-aged and older adults  with MDD. This easily-disseminated intervention may rescue CCN dysfunction present  in a substantial subset of middle-aged and older adults with MDD.},

  abstract = {Background: The Coloboma mouse carries a similar to 2 cM deletion encompassing the SNAP25 gene and has a hyperactive phenotype similar to that of ADHD. Such mice are 3 fold more active compared to their control littermates. Genetic association studies support a role for allelic variants of the human SNAP25 gene in predisposing to ADHD. Methods/Principal Findings: We performed association analysis across the SNAP25 gene in 1,107 individuals (339 ADHD trios). To assess the functional relevance of the SNAP25-ADHD associated allele, we performed quantitative PCR on postmortem tissue derived from the inferior frontal gyrus of 89 unaffected adults. Significant associations with the A allele of SNP rs362990 (chi(2) = 10, p-corrected = 0.019, OR = 1.5) and three marker haplotypes (rs6108461, rs362990 and rs362998) were observed. Furthermore, a significant additive decrease in the expression of the SNAP25 transcript as a function of the risk allele was also observed. This effect was detected at the haplotype level, where increasing copies of the ADHD-associated haplotype reduced the expression of the transcript. Conclusions: Our data show that DNA variation at SNAP25 confers risk to ADHD and reduces the expression of the transcript in a region of the brain that is critical for the regulation of attention and inhibition.},

This review explores the factors that should be considered when introducing electronic laboratory notebooks to an academically focused research group. We cite pertinent studies and discuss our own experience implementing a system within a multidisciplinary research environment. We also consider how the required financial and time investment is shared between individuals and institutions. Finally, we discuss how electronic laboratory notebooks fit into the broader context of research data management.

Researchers devote time and effort to search relevant manuscripts when writing a paper or simply to keep up with current research. In this paper, we consider the problem of citation recommendation by extending a set of known-to-be-relevant references. Our analysis shows the degrees of cited papers in the subgraph induced by the citations of a paper, called projection graph, follow a power law distribution. Existing popular methods are only good at finding the long tail papers, the ones that are highly connected to others. In other words, the majority of cited papers are loosely connected in the projection graph but they are not going to be found by existing methods. To address this problem, we propose to combine author, venue and keyword information to interpret the citation behavior behind those loosely connected papers. Results show that different methods are finding cited papers with widely different properties. We suggest multiple recommended lists by different algorithms could satisfy various users for a real citation recommendation system.},

Notre analyse repose sur une étude comparative et transnationale de l’évaluation des biotechnologies, avec une focale sur les risques liés au clonage animal, en Europe et aux États-Unis. Quelles sont les connaissances produites en relation à un cadre réglementaire et institutionnel qu’elles contribuent à construire ? Nous identifions deux modes de production différenciés d’expertise scientifique dans lesquels la science réglementaire est plus ou moins centrale et qui associent différentes façons de produire de la connaissance (formes de raisonnement, traitement de l’incertitude, hiérarchie des sources de connaissance) et différentes façons de réguler les activités (architectures institutionnelles, ressources réglementaires, sources d’autorité). La production d’expertise s’avère donc prise dans l’ensemble des règles que forme cette « science réglementaire » qui, portant la marque des histoires nationales, entrave fortement les efforts d’harmonisation.},

Prevailing expectations posit that literacy interventions help audiences to be “inoculated” against any harmful effects of misleading information. This study empirically investigates such assumptions by assessing whether individuals with greater literacy (media, information, news, and digital literacies) are better at recognizing fake news, and which of these literacies are most relevant. The results reveal that information literacy—but not other literacies—significantly increases the likelihood of identifying fake news stories. Interpreting the results, we provide both conceptual and methodological explanations. Particularly, we raise questions about the self-reported competencies that are commonly used in literacy scales.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}As children are under-represented in current studies aiming to analyse transmission of SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), their contribution to transmission is unclear. Viral load, as measured by RT-PCR, can inform considerations regarding transmission, especially if existing knowledge of viral load in other respiratory diseases is taken into account. RT-PCR threshold cycle data from 3303 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (out of 77,996 persons tested in total, drawn from across Germany) were analysed to examine the relationship between patient age and estimated viral load. Two PCR systems were used. In data from the PCR system predominantly used for community and cluster screening during the early phase of the epidemic (Roche LightCycler 480 II), when such screening was frequent practice, viral loads do not differ significantly in three comparisons between young and old age groups (differences in log\textsubscript{10} viral loads between young and old estimated from raw viral load data and a Bayesian mixture model of gamma distributions collectively range between −0.11 and −0.43). Data from a second type of PCR system (Roche cobas 6800/8800), introduced into diagnostic testing on March 16, 2020 and used during the time when household and other contact testing was reduced, show a credible but small difference in the three comparisons between young and old age groups (differences, measured as above, collectively range between −0.43 and −0.83). This small difference may be due to differential patterns of PCR instrument utilization rather than to an actual difference in viral load. Considering household transmission data on influenza, which has a similar viral load kinetic to SARS-CoV-2, the viral load differences between age groups observed in this study are likely to be of limited relevance. Combined data from both PCR instruments show that viral loads of at least 250,000 copies, a threshold we previously established for the isolation of infectious virus in cell culture at more than 5\% probability, were present across the study period in 29.0\% of kindergarten-aged patients 0-6 years old (n=38), 37.3\% of those aged 0-19 (n=150), and in 51.4\% of those aged 20 and above (n=3153). The differences in these fractions may also be due to differences in test utilization. We conclude that a considerable percentage of infected people in all age groups, including those who are pre- or mild-symptomatic, carry viral loads likely to represent infectivity. Based on these results and uncertainty about the remaining incidence, we recommend caution and careful monitoring during gradual lifting of non-pharmaceutical interventions. In particular, there is little evidence from the present study to support suggestions that children may not be as infectious as adults.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In its simplest form, the problem reflects the use of externally invalid measures of the dynamics that generate cultural conflict over risk and other policy-relevant facts. But at a more fundamental level, the science-of-science-communication measurement problem inheres in the phenomena being measured themselves. The “beliefs” individuals form about a societal risk such as climate change are not of a piece; rather they reflect the distinct clusters of inferences that individuals draw as they engage information for two distinct ends: to gain access to the collective knowledge furnished by science and to enjoy the sense of identity enabled by membership in a community defined by particular cultural commitments. The article shows how appropriately designed “science comprehension” tests—one general and one specific to climate change—can be used to measure individuals’ reasoning proficiency as collective-knowledge acquirers independently of their reasoning proficiency as cultural-identity protectors. Doing so reveals that there is in fact little disagreement among culturally diverse citizens on what science knows about climate change. The source of the climate-change controversy and like disputes over societal risks is the contamination of the science-communication environment with forms of cultural status competition that make it impossible for diverse citizens to express their reason as both collective-knowledge acquirers and cultural-identity protectors at the same time.},

In an experiment embedded within a nationally representative survey of youth ages 15 to 27 (N = 2,101), youth were asked to judge the accuracy of one of several simulated online posts. Consistent with research on motivated reasoning, youth assessments depended on (a) the alignment of the claim with one’s prior policy position and to a lesser extent on (b) whether the post included an inaccurate statement. To consider ways educators might improve judgments of accuracy, we also investigated the influence of political knowledge and exposure to media literacy education.

It has weak but definite anti-inflammatory properties similar to those of aspirin, milligram for milligram, but with considerably less adverse effect on the stomach. Ibuprofen is chemically related to fenoprofen and naproxen, but lack of effect for any one in this chemical class of propionic-acid derivatives does not necessarily mean lack of effect for any other in an individual patient. The drug has analgesic properties, probably related to its anti-inflammatory effect. It inhibits prostaglandin synthesis and has no effect on the adrenopituitary axis, making it a nonsteroidal agent. Ibuprofen has been shown to be effective in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis and is probably effective in ankylosing spondylitis, gout, and Bartter's syndrome.},

  abstract = {"Rumors may be the oldest medium of mass communication of information or ideas. Even before there were newspapers, radio, or television, rumors communicated by word-of-mouth made and shattered reputations, and set off riots and wars. Yet contrary to predictions, rumors continue to thrive, in spite of and parallel to mass media. What accounts for the puzzling persistence and continuing significance of this little-studied social phenomenon? Jean-No;el Kapferer examines the theory and practice of rumors, focusing on specific areas such as entertainment, criminal behavior, business and finance, and politics. He describes the kinds of conditions that give birth to rumors, why we believe them, and the hidden messages they convey. Kapferer points out that rumors frequently serve useful social purposes and present rich examples. He speculates about how rumors can be controlled, changed, and prevented. Drawing upon contributions of disciplines ranging from psychology to history, and integrating the insights of Europeans with the latest work of American researchers, this is the most comprehensive examination of rumors, gossip, and urban legends yet published. Translated into nine languages, this edition was updated with advances in theory and research since the book's original French publication in 1987. Its brisk, accessible style makes the book of interest to psychologists, economists, political scientists, sociologists, and folklore analysts, as well as the general reader who is curious about the origins of this fascinating social phenomenon."--Provided by publisher.},

While existing studies have attended to Islam’s engagement with capitalism, less attention has been given to the ideological intimacy of this relationship and, in particular, the increasing presence of radical free market thought in global Islamist politics, or what I have termed ‘libertarian Islamism’. The dominant narrative of Islamism, thus, constricts our understanding of the wider ideological ecology at play in the global political mobilization of Islam. While political Islam is often regarded as being rooted in a broadly leftist intellectual milieu, it has rather encapsulated variant conceptions of liberty, both left and right, and is currently undergoing what one might term a ‘free-market turn’. Within this milieu, a distinctly radical, anti-statist libertarian ideology has also emerged with an intimate relationship to conservative libertarian activists in the West. The presence of libertarian Islamism serves to recalibrate dominant understandings of ‘radical’ Islam and its purportedly fractious ideological relationship with the West.},

Menteur par vocation, par profession et par nécessité conjugale, il est l'heureux détenteur d'une double vie, entre son épouse et ses deux enfants à Vitoria, et sa maîtresse torride à Madrid. Pour l'heure, sa mission est de faire entrer dans le grand bain national le jeune élu local Javier Morodo, dont l'homosexualité assumée offrira un gaywashing au Parti, trop longtemps accusé d'homophobie.

  abstract = {Open access publishing has frequently been proposed as a solution to the serials crisis, which involved unsustainable budgetary pressures on libraries due to hyperinflation of subscription costs. The majority of open access articles are published in a minority of journals that levy article processing charges (APCs) paid by authors or their institutions upon acceptance. Increases in APCs is proceeding at a rate three times that which would be expected if APCs were indexed according to inflation. As increasingly ambitious funder mandates are proposed, such as Plan S, it is important to evaluate whether authors show signs of price sensitivity in journal selection by avoiding journals that introduce or increase their APCs. Examining journals that introduced an APC 4-5 years after launch or when flipping from a subscription model to immediate open access model showed no evidence that APC introduction reduced article volumes. Multilevel modelling of APC sensitivity across 319 journals published by the four largest APC-funded dedicated commercial open access publishers (BMC, Frontiers, MDPI, and Hindawi) revealed that from 2012 to 2018 higher APCs were actually associated with increased article volumes. These findings indicate that APC hyperinflation is not suppressed through market competition and author choice. Instead, demand for scholarly journal publications may be more similar to demand for necessities, or even prestige goods, which will support APC hyperinflation to the detriment of researchers, institutions, and funders.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Removing artificial food coloring (AFC) is a common dietary intervention for children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), but has not been tested in young adults. This pilot study examined the effects of AFC on ADHD symptoms and electroencephalography (EEG) in college students with and without ADHD. Methods: At baseline, control and ADHD participants completed the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS), simple and complex attention measures, and resting-state EEG recordings. ADHD participants (n = 18) and a subset of controls (extended control group or EC, n = 11) avoided AFC in their diet for 2 weeks and then were randomized to a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover challenge. Subjects received either 225 mg AFC disguised in chocolate cookies or placebo chocolate cookies for 3 days each week, with testing on the third day each week. Baseline comparisons were made using Student's t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum tests and challenge period analyses were run using General Linear Modeling. Results: The ADHD group had significantly greater scores on the ASRS (p {$<$} 0.001), confirming a symptom differential between groups; however, there were no differences in attentional measures or EEG at baseline. The AFC challenge resulted in an increase in posterior mean gamma power (p = 0.05), a decrease in posterior relative alpha power (p = 0.04), and a marginal increase in inattentive symptoms (p = 0.08) in the ADHD group. There were no effects of AFC in the EC group. Discussion: This study indicates that AFC exposure may affect brainwave activity and ADHD symptoms in college students with ADHD. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Removing artificial food coloring (AFC) is a common dietary intervention for children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), but has not been tested in young adults. This pilot study examined the effects of AFC on ADHD symptoms and electroencephalography (EEG) in college students with and without ADHD. Methods: At baseline, control and ADHD participants completed the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS), simple and complex attention measures, and resting-state EEG recordings. ADHD participants (n = 18) and a subset of controls (extended control group or EC, n = 11) avoided AFC in their diet for 2 weeks and then were randomized to a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover challenge. Subjects received either 225 mg AFC disguised in chocolate cookies or placebo chocolate cookies for 3 days each week, with testing on the third day each week. Baseline comparisons were made using Student's t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum tests and challenge period analyses were run using General Linear Modeling. Results: The ADHD group had significantly greater scores on the ASRS (p {$<$} 0.001), confirming a symptom differential between groups; however, there were no differences in attentional measures or EEG at baseline. The AFC challenge resulted in an increase in posterior mean gamma power (p = 0.05), a decrease in posterior relative alpha power (p = 0.04), and a marginal increase in inattentive symptoms (p = 0.08) in the ADHD group. There were no effects of AFC in the EC group. Discussion: This study indicates that AFC exposure may affect brainwave activity and ADHD symptoms in college students with ADHD. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.},

  abstract = {Academic publishers claim that they add value to scholarly communications by coordinating reviews and contributing and enhancing text during publication. These contributions come at a considerable cost: U.S. academic libraries paid \$1.7 billion for serial subscriptions in 2008 alone. Library budgets, in contrast, are flat and not able to keep pace with serial price inflation. We have investigated the publishers' value proposition by conducting a comparative study of pre-print papers and their final published counterparts. This comparison had two working assumptions: 1) if the publishers' argument is valid, the text of a pre-print paper should vary measurably from its corresponding final published version, and 2) by applying standard similarity measures, we should be able to detect and quantify such differences. Our analysis revealed that the text contents of the scientific papers generally changed very little from their pre-print to final published versions. These findings contribute empirical indicators to discussions of the added value of commercial publishers and therefore should influence libraries' economic decisions regarding access to scholarly publications.},

La crise sanitaire a toutefois montré avec éclat que nous n'avons guère retenu la leçon, révélant l'ambivalence de notre rapport à la science et le peu de crédit que nous accordons à la rationalité qu'il lui revient d'établir. Lorsque, d'un côté, l'inculture prend le pouvoir, que, de l'autre, l'argument d'autorité écrase tout sur son passage, lorsque la crédibilité de la recherche ploie sous la force de l'évènement et de l'opinion, comment garder le goût du vrai - celui de découvrir, d'apprendre, de comprendre ?

  abstract = {The United Kingdom and European Union recently restricted the use of artificial food colorings (AFCs) to improve the health of children. These decisions provide an interesting case study of the role of scientific evidence in the assessment of food additives and risk to children's health and formulation of food policy. Although there continues to be uncertainty concerning the link between AFCs and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), policy decisions have been made that have far-reaching implications. In addition, publicity surrounding the policy changes may shape public perceptions concerning effective management of ADHD. We believe that the balance of existing evidence neither refutes nor supports the link between AFCs and ADHD, which highlights the need for carefully designed studies to further investigate the link between AFCs and ADHD. In this article we describe a model for such studies. In developing our model, we drew from current investigative standards in ADHD research, such as those used in the landmark Multimodal Treatment Study of Children With ADHD. These standards encompass methodologic considerations including sample selection, outcome assessment, and data analyses. It is our hope that this model research methodology may prove valuable in addressing design considerations in future studies of AFCs and ADHD with the goal of producing reliable data that will enable policy-makers to better formulate effective, evidence-based food-policy decisions.},

  abstract = {Over the past half century, two overarching questions have dominated the study of mass political behavior: How do ordinary citizens form their political judgments, and how good are those judgments from a normative perspective? The authors of The Ambivalent Partisan offer a novel approach to these questions, one in which political reasoning is viewed as arising from trade-offs among three generally conflicting psychological goals: making decisions easily, getting them right, and maintaining cognitive consistency. Taking aim at decades of received wisdom, the central claim of this book is that high-quality political judgment hinges less on citizens' cognitive ability than on their willingness to temporarily suspend partisan habits and follow the "evidence" wherever it leads. This occurs most readily when citizens experience a disjuncture between their stable political identities and their contemporary evaluations of party performance, a state the authors refer to as partisan ambivalence. Drawing on both experimental and survey methods -- as well as five decades of American political history -- the authors demonstrate that compared to other citizens, ambivalent partisans perceive the political world accurately, form their policy preferences in a principled manner, and communicate those preferences by making issues an important component of their electoral decisions. The book's most important conclusion is that a non-trivial portion of the electorate manages to escape the vicissitudes of apathy or wanton bias, and it is these citizens -- these ambivalent partisans -- who reliably approximate a desirable standard of democratic citizenship.},

  abstract = {"En travail. Conversations sur le communisme" : c'est le titre du livre récemment publié par Bernard Friot et Frédéric Lordon aux éditions La Dispute, fruit d'échanges entre ces deux figures de la pensée de gauche organisés au printemps dernier par Amélie Jeammet.  Avec Julien Théry, qui les reçoit pour Le Média, les deux auteurs reviennent sur leurs points d'accord, qui portent sur l'essentiel : le communisme réel ne peut se développer ni en fuyant l'économie, les institutions et toute et la sphère de la production capitaliste dans des dissidences, ni en s'en remettant à un futur mythique et messianique. Bernard Friot s’intéresse à la poursuite de la construction d’institutions alternatives au capitalisme : salaire à vie, propriété d’usage, souveraineté sur l’investissement. Frédéric Lordon développe une philosophie spinoziste des institutions, après avoir, comme économiste, analysé le capitalisme financiarisé. Leurs trajectoires scientifiques et militantes sensiblement différentes n’en convergent pas moins sur la nécessité d’une proposition communiste qui donnerait à une mobilisation générale l’appui de figures et de réalisations concrètes. Il fallait une authentique rencontre intellectuelle, avec ce qu’elle suppose de confrontation fraternelle des idées, pour aboutir ainsi à cette mise en travail du communisme. ▶ Ni actionnaire, ni publicité, Le Média TV est indépendant et ne vit que de vos dons :  👉 https://www.lemediatv.fr/soutien ▶ Soutenez Le Média :  👉 https://www.lemediatv.fr/soutien 👉 https://www.okpal.com/le-media/ 👉 https://fr.tipeee.com/le-media ✅  Suivez-nous :  Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/lemedia\_tv/ Facebook : http://bit.ly/FacebookLeMedia Twitter : http://bit.ly/TwitterLeMedia Youtube : http://bit.ly/YouTubeLeMedia Peertube : https://video.lemediatv.fr Telegram :  https://t.me/LeMediaOfficiel Rejoignez la communauté des Socios !},

At times, it is used as a guide for organizing lessons, at other times it is used with the intention of summarizing essential curricular content. The way in which PowerPoint is used and the form it takes differs between faculties. The present article aims to evaluate the impact of the provision of slides on student academic performance and attendance (regardless of test scores). For this purpose, a quasi-experimental study was carried out with two intrasubject manipulated learning situations in which copies of slides created by teachers were, or were not, made available to students prior to class sessions. Additionally, student academic engagement and study strategies were assessed using two scales in order to analyse whether these variables modified the relationship between access to slides and academic performance. Outcomes revealed that access to slides developed by teachers had a negative impact on student performance and attendance to classes. Student academic engagement and study strategies were found to modify the relationship between academic performance and access to slides.},

  abstract = {In order to improve appetite, attract consumers and even conform to the food culture, food coloring has become one of the necessary links in modern food processing. For example, dried-tofu will be colored by adding artificial food colors (AFCs) such as sunset yellow, cochineal red A or other seasonings like soy sauce. However, the dispute persists about whether AFCs are harmful to health. Some studies indicate AFCs affect children's intelligence and attention, cause hyperactivity, and allergy when children consumed {$>$}= 50 mg. In addition, researches showed that chemical soy sauce produces a trace of methylglyoxal (MGO) in the manufacturing process, which is related to diseases such as oxidative stress, diabetes, and cognitive deterioration. Therefore, natural pigments are relatively new and promising strategy for replacing high-risk AFCs. Thus, the objective of this study was to use dried-tofu as a natural colorants coloring screening platform, through the concept of three primary colors to discuss the coloring effects of natural colorants in Taiwan in double-phase (liquid phase to solid phase) food coloring system and assess the effects of MGO on PC12 neuron cellular morphology and cell cycle at the dietary exposure in soy sauce. Our results showed that formula G:R = 0.2:0.8 and C:R = 0.08:0.92 were coloring by combined natural colorants had the same eye sensory quality acceptance of consumer and had the intention to purchase. Furthermore, the results from the PC12 cell suggested that dietary exposure of methylglyoxal ({$<$}50 mu M) in soy sauce did not affect neuron cellular morphology and cell cycle significantly. Overall, Gardenia Yellow, Curcumin, and Radish Red could overcome the application restrictions in multiple-phase food coloring system and simultaneously soy sauce as a coloring agent was safety. It showed the possibility of them as food colorants on dried-tofu. (C) 2018 "Society information". Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Cognitive biases are systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment, and are often studied in psychology and behavioral economics. Although the reality of most of these biases is confirmed by reproducible research, there are often controversies about how to classify these biases or how to explain them. Some are effects of information-processing rules (i.e., mental shortcuts), called heuristics, that the brain uses to produce decisions or judgments. Biases have a variety of forms and appear as cognitive ("cold") bias, such as mental noise, or motivational ("hot") bias, such as when beliefs are distorted by wishful thinking. Both effects can be present at the same time.There are also controversies over some of these biases as to whether they count as useless or irrational, or whether they result in useful attitudes or behavior. For example, when getting to know others, people tend to ask leading questions which seem biased towards confirming their assumptions about the person. However, this kind of confirmation bias has also been argued to be an example of social skill: a way to establish a connection with the other person.Although this research overwhelmingly involves human subjects, some findings that demonstrate bias have been found in non-human animals as well. For example, loss aversion has been shown in monkeys and hyperbolic discounting has been observed in rats, pigeons, and monkeys.},

  abstract = {The communication and regulation of risk has changed significantly over the past 30 years in Europe and to a noticeable but lesser extent in the United States. In Europe, this is partly due to a series of regulatory mishaps, ranging from mad cow disease in the United Kingdom to contamination of the blood supply in France. In the United States, general public confidence in the American government has been gradually declining for more than three decades, driven by a mix of cultural and political conflicts like negative political advertising, a corrosive news media, and cuts in regulatory budgets. While the former approach is based on an objective assessment of the risk, the latter is driven more by the perception of the risk, consumer sentiment, political will, and sectoral advocacy. In this article, the author examines three U.S.-based food case studies (acrylamide, bisphenol A, and artificial food colorings) where regulations at the local and state levels are increasingly being based on perceived risk advocacy rather than on the most effective response to the risk, be it to food safety or public health, as defined by regulatory interpretation of existing data. In the final section, the author puts forward a series of recommendations for how U.S.-based regulators can best handle those situations where the perceived risk is markedly different from the fact-based risk, such as strengthening the communication departments of food regulatory agencies, training officials in risk communication, and working more proactively with neutral third-party experts.},

Cette fois c’est la planète elle-même qui nous somme. Ou plutôt la planète telle que nous nous la rendons à nous-mêmes inhabitables. Sur ce front-là, on ne tergiverse pas, on ne négocie pas, on n’atermoie pas. Le changement climatique est en marche et, pour la première fois, la Covid-19 nous a fait apercevoir que nous n’aurions pas seulement à en souffrir les canicules, les épisodes météorologiques extrêmes ou les pieds dans l’eau, mais également la libération de virus dont celui qui nous met presque à genoux en ce moment est sans doute l’un des plus «~bénins~».~Posée l’urgence de la situation, c’est l’urgence de penser la situation qui est posée avec elle. Mais peut-être «~penser~» n’est-il pas le mot le plus approprié quand il s’agit de donner le plus de chances à la bonne branche de la bifurcation. «~Imaginer~» pourrait être meilleur. Car la politique, dès lors qu’elle n’a pas pour seule ambition de reconduire l’ordre des choses à l’identique, au moment même où elle fait face à l’obligation impérieuse de faire advenir du radicalement différent, la politique, donc, est affaire d’imagination, au sens littéral du mot~: d’offrir des images. Ou des figures. Aller vers un avenir suppose de s’en être donné des figures.~C’est ce que ce livre s’essaye à faire, à partir d’une position de principes fondamentaux, dont le premier énonce qu’une société communiste a pour devoir de relever les individus de la précarité, de les libérer de l’angoisse des lendemains dans laquelle le marché capitaliste, qui détient toutes les données de leur reproduction matérielle, les plonge inévitablement – et l’effrayante crise sociale qui s’annonce à la suite de la crise sanitaire se chargera d’en donner l’illustration. L’instrument de cette libération s’appelle «~la garantie économique générale~». Elle est directement inspirée des travaux de Bernard Friot sur le «~salaire à vie~». Et se pose très explicitement la question d’un nouveau mode de production, c’est- à-dire des nouveaux rapports sociaux propres à soutenir une division du travail développée en ses multiples échelles~: du local au global.~Sous cette condition, tous les rapports sociaux peuvent être repensés – et en l’occurrence les rapports du capitalisme abolis~: rapport salarial, rapports de propriété privée des moyens de production, rapports financiers. C’est ici qu’aident les figures : à donner des images de ces perspectives constamment renvoyées au registre de «~l’utopie~». Là où les figurations progressent, les disqualifications par l’utopie s’effacent.~Mais ça n’est pas tout d’avoir des figures~: il faut aussi imaginer les trajectoires politiques qui permettent de les rejoindre. Au moins en poser les données fondamentale~: le type de résistance que la bourgeoisie opposera à la disparition de son monde, le type de dynamique politique que cette résistance appellera, le type de bloc social à constituer pour prévaloir, notamment les alliances à passer entre luttes anticapitalistes et luttes antiracistes, enfin la manière dont se redéploie la question internationaliste.},

La fortune de ses énoncés recouvre parfois la profondeur de leurs soubassements philosophiques. Auxquels on peut donner la consistance d’une «\,antipolitique\,», entendue soit comme politique restreinte à des intermittences («\,devenirs\,», «\,repartages du sensible\,»), soit comme politique réservée à des virtuoses («\,sujets\,», «\,singularités quelconques\,»). Soit enfin comme politique de «\,la destitution\,». Destituer, précisément, c’est ne pas réinstituer – mais le pouvons-nous\,? Ici, une vue spinoziste des institutions répond que la puissance du collectif s’exerce nécessairement et que, par «\,institution\,», il faut entendre tout effet de cette puissance. Donc que le fait institutionnel est le mode d’être même du collectif. S’il en est ainsi, chercher la formule de «\,la vie sans institutions\,» est une impasse. En matière d’institution, la question pertinente n’est pas «\,avec ou sans\,?\,» – il y en aura. C’est celle de la forme à leur donner.

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic is an international public health crisis without precedent in the last century. The novelty and rapid spread of the virus have added a new urgency to the availability and distribution of reliable information to help curb its fatal potential. As seasoned and trusted purveyors of reliable public information, librarians have attempted to respond to the “infodemic” of fake news, disinformation, and propaganda with a variety of strategies, but the COVID-19 pandemic presents a unique challenge because of the deadly stakes involved. The seriousness of the current situation requires that librarians and associated professionals re-evaluate the ethical basis of their approach to information provision to counter the growing prominence of conspiracy theories in the public sphere and official decision making. This paper analyzes the conspiracy mindset and specific COVID-19 conspiracy theories in discussing how libraries might address the problems of truth and untruth in ethically sound ways. As a contribution to the re-evaluation we propose, the paper presents an ethical framework based on alethic rights—or rights to truth—as conceived by Italian philosopher Franca D’Agostini and how these might inform professional approaches that support personal safety, open knowledge, and social justice.},

  abstract = {Background One of people’s major motives for going online is the search for health-related information. Most consumers start their search with a general search engine but are unaware of the fact that its sorting and ranking criteria do not mirror information quality. This misconception can lead to distorted search outcomes, especially when the information processing is characterized by heuristic principles and resulting cognitive biases instead of a systematic elaboration. As vaccination opponents are vocal on the Web, the chance of encountering their non‒evidence-based views on immunization is high. Therefore, biased information processing in this context can cause subsequent impaired judgment and decision making. A technological debiasing strategy could counter this by changing people’s search environment. Objective This study aims at testing a technological debiasing strategy to reduce the negative effects of biased information processing when using a general search engine on people’s vaccination-related knowledge and attitudes. This strategy is to manipulate the content of Google’s knowledge graph box, which is integrated in the search interface and provides basic information about the search topic. Methods A full 3x2 factorial, posttest-only design was employed with availability of basic factual information (comprehensible vs hardly comprehensible vs not present) as the first factor and a warning message as the second factor of experimental manipulation. Outcome variables were the evaluation of the knowledge graph box, vaccination-related knowledge, as well as beliefs and attitudes toward vaccination, as represented by three latent variables emerged from an exploratory factor analysis. Results Two-way analysis of variance revealed a significant main effect of availability of basic information in the knowledge graph box on participants’ vaccination knowledge scores (F2,273=4.86, P=.01), skepticism/fear of vaccination side effects (F2,273=3.5, P=.03), and perceived information quality (F2,273=3.73, P=.02). More specifically, respondents receiving comprehensible information appeared to be more knowledgeable, less skeptical of vaccination, and more critical of information quality compared to participants exposed to hardly comprehensible information. Although, there was no significant interaction effect between the availability of information and the presence of the warning, there was a dominant pattern in which the presence of the warning appeared to have a positive influence on the group receiving comprehensible information while the opposite was true for the groups exposed to hardly comprehensible information and no information at all. Participants evaluated the knowledge graph box as moderately to highly useful, with no significant differences among the experimental groups. Conclusion Overall, the results suggest that comprehensible information in the knowledge graph box positively affects participants’ vaccination-related knowledge and attitudes. A small change in the content retrieval procedure currently used by Google could already make a valuable difference in the pursuit of an unbiased online information search. Further research is needed to gain insights into the knowledge graph box’s entire potential.},

Le concept d'Anthropocène, s'il a le mérite de nommer le problème, peine à identifier les coupables et s'empêtre dans le récit millénaire d'une humanité pyromane. Or si l'on veut comprendre le réchauffement climatique, ce ne sont pas les archives de "l'espèce humaine" qu'il faut sonder mais celles de l'Empire britannique, pour commencer. On y apprend par exemple que dans les années 1830 la vapeur était, aux mains des capitalistes anglais, un outil redoutable pour discipliner la force de travail et une arme de guerre impérialiste ; on y suit la progression fulgurante de la machine mise au point par James Watt qui supplante en quelques années la force hydraulique - pourtant abondante et moins chère - dans l'industrie textile anglaise. En puisant dans les sources de l'histoire sociale, ce livre raconte l'avènement du "capital fossile", ou comment la combustion ininterrompue de charbon a permis de repousser les limites de l'exploitation et du profit. Il faut couper la mèche qui brûle avant que l'étincelle n'atteigne la dynamite, écrivait Walter Benjamin dans un fragment célèbre, "Avertisseur d'incendie", où il insistait sur la nécessité d'en finir avec le capitalisme avant qu'il ne s'autodétruise et emporte tout avec lui. Pour Andreas Malm, on ne peut mieux dire l'urgence contemporaine de défaire l'économie fossile par des mesures révolutionnaires."},

Une transaction secrète, couverte par les services français, qui va permettre au dictateur de surveiller de près ses opposants. Certains seront torturés après avoir été repérés par le logiciel Eagle. Jean-Marc Manach a enquêté sur ce scandale qui implique le colonel Kadhafi, son beau-frère Abdallah al-Senoussi (chef des services de renseignements et accessoirement condamné à perpétuité pour l’attentat du DC-10 d’UTA en 1989), l’état français (avec sa tête Nicolas Sarkozy) et le devenu célèbre homme d’affaire libanais Ziad Takieddine. Il découvre que les employés d’Amesys n’avaient pas pris la peine de déployer les mesures de sécurité que prennent d’ordinaire les entreprises commerçant avec des dictateurs. Façon Pieds Nickelés, ils ont même été jusqu’à mettre sur le web des preuves de leurs méfaits. Ce qui pourrait paraître être une farce burlesque n’en est pas moins une tragédie quand on imagine le nombre de personnes qui ont été tuées ou torturées à cause de ces surveillances.},

Si les partisans de la mondialisation ont d'abord cru que les outils numériques contribueraient à la diffusion du modèle libéral, force est de constater que l'information crée des vulnérabilités nouvelles qui peuvent compromettre le fonctionnement de la démocratie. Au XXIe siècle plus qu'auparavant, la puissance des États se fonde sur le contrôle de l'information et sur leur capacité à influencer des audiences extérieures et à diffuser leur interprétation du monde. L'étude des guerres de l'information à l'ère numérique permet de comprendre comment différents États, démocratiques ou autoritaires, se servent de l'information pour accroître leur influence et redessiner les équilibres de pouvoir sur la scène internationale. De la présentation de la dimension technique des manipulations de l'information à l'exploration des doctrines et des pratiques de dix pays suivant une grille d'analyse commune, cet ouvrage propose une approche globale et des comparaisons inédites avant de s'interroger sur les effets de la désinformation et les possibilités de régulation par le droit."

In response, this paper investigates 3,073,351 citations found by these six data sources to 2,515 English-language highly-cited documents published in 2006 from 252 subject categories, expanding and updating the largest previous study. Google Scholar found 88\% of all citations, many of which were not found by the other sources, and nearly all citations found by the remaining sources (89–94\%). A similar pattern held within most subject categories. Microsoft Academic is the second largest overall (60\% of all citations), including 82\% of Scopus citations and 86\% of WoS citations. In most categories, Microsoft Academic found more citations than Scopus and WoS (182 and 223 subject categories, respectively), but had coverage gaps in some areas, such as Physics and some Humanities categories. After Scopus, Dimensions is fourth largest (54\% of all citations), including 84\% of Scopus citations and 88\% of WoS citations. It found more citations than Scopus in 36 categories, more than WoS in 185, and displays some coverage gaps, especially in the Humanities. Following WoS, COCI is the smallest, with 28\% of all citations. Google Scholar is still the most comprehensive source. In many subject categories Microsoft Academic and Dimensions are good alternatives to Scopus and WoS in terms of coverage.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is commonly associated with neurocognitive dysfunction. However, there remains substantial heterogeneity between  patients and inconsistent findings regarding the magnitude and prevalence of  specific neurocognitive deficits. This study aimed to investigate the potential for  different neurocognitive subgroups in patients diagnosed with MDD. METHOD: Data were  pooled from 4 different clinical trials that involved adults diagnosed with MDD.  Neurocognitive outcomes included measures of verbal learning and memory, executive  function, attention, and processing speed. Latent class analysis was conducted to  examine for different subgroups based on neurocognitive profiles of performance  across outcome measures. Subgroups were compared to a separate sample of age-matched  adult healthy controls, across illness factors, and individual mood items on the  Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). RESULTS: Within the MDD cohort (N  = 149), 45\% of participants were considered relatively "cognitively preserved," with  the remainder "cognitively reduced" (39\%) or "cognitively impaired" (16\%). Verbal  memory performance was significantly poorer compared to attention and processing  speed only in the "cognitively impaired" subgroup. There was no association between  subgroup membership and relevant illness factors, including ratings on individual  MADRS items. LIMITATIONS: Data were pooled from several studies that included  different neurocognitive measures and cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately half of  MDD participants had no or minimal objective cognitive difficulties, and  neurocognitive functioning was found generally unrelated to illness factors. Future  longitudinal research is warranted to determine whether the people who are  relatively cognitively impaired are at increased risk for further cognitive decline.

  abstract = {Objective: We evaluated processing-speed and shift-cost measures in adults with depression or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and monitored the effects of treatment. We hypothesised that cognitive-speed and shift-cost measures might differentiate diagnostic groups. Methods: Colour, form, and colour-form stimuli were used to measure naming times. The shift costs were calculated as colour-form-naming time minus the sum of colour- and form-naming times. Measurements were done at baseline and end point for 42 adults with depression and 42 with ADHD without depression. Patients with depression were treated with transcranial pulsed electromagnetic fields and patients with ADHD with methylphenidate immediate release. Results: During depression treatment, reductions in naming times were recorded weekly. One-way analysis of variance indicated statistical between-group differences, with effect sizes in the medium range for form and colour-form. In both groups, naming times were longer before than after treatment. For the ADHD group, shift costs exceeded the average-normal range at baseline but were in the average-normal range after stabilisation with stimulant medication. For the depression group, shift costs were in the average-normal range at baseline and after treatment. Baseline colour-form-naming times predicted reductions in naming times for both groups, with the largest effect size and index of forecasting efficiency for the ADHD group. Conclusions: The cognitive-processing-speed (colour-form) and shift-cost measures before treatment proved most sensitive in differentiating patients with depression and ADHD. Reductions in naming times for the depression group were suggested to reflect improved psychomotor skills rather than improved cognitive control.},

  abstract = {Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic has placed online learning, blended or hybrid provision as the "new normal" in Higher Education. For most universities and their academic libraries, especially those with a less strong online presence, the pandemic has caused numerous challenges. However, it has also been a catalyst for change and resifting of priorities. For academic librarians involved in the delivery of information skills/literacy training, a renewed mission is emerging, addressing access and connectivity to resources, designing for online education and fostering the development of digital literacy of students. Design/methodology/approach This is a conceptual paper based on the author's personal experiences and subjective opinion as a Library and Information Science educator with considerable expertise in online distance learning in the UK. Reflecting critically on the impact of the pandemic from an educational point of view and on key changes experienced, the paper centres on the argument that academic librarians could emerge as strategic partners in Higher Education, towards the direction of enhancing students' digital competences development. Findings The complete and involuntary shift to online learning due to COVID-19 restrictions has opened the door to multiple challenges in Higher Education, which are complex and ongoing: the implementation of remote tools and practices en masse in online teaching and learning in a way that ensures accessibility and equity for all, issues connecting to online pedagogy and how to prepare students with the information and digital literacy competences required for the new online learning "normal". As academic libraries move forward, they have a renewed mission to help learners in the online space to become both information rich and digitally competent. There is an opportunity to act as the connecting link that will help to move a step forward a strategic vision that places design for equity at the centre of education. Originality/value The impact of COVID-19 within Higher Education and academic libraries more specifically, is a theme that has not been yet sufficiently discussed, researched or critically debated as the world is still currently going through the pandemic crisis. This paper aims to initiate some early thoughts and conversation, as well as put forward the author's personal critical positioning on the issues, challenges and potential opportunities, emerging in the current educational climate for academic librarians, and to highlight areas of importance for the design and direction of information and library science curricula.},

  abstract = {Due to the high amount of artificial food colorants present in infants' diets, their adverse effects have been of major concern among the literature. Artificial food colorants have been suggested to affect children's behavior, being hyperactivity the most common disorder. In this study we compare binding affinities of a group of artificial colorants (sunset yellow, quinoline yellow, carmoisine, allura red and tartrazine) and their natural industrial equivalents (carminic acid, curcumin, peonidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-glucoside) to human serum albumin (HSA) by a docking approach and further refinement through atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Due to the protein-ligand conformational interface complexity, we used collective variable driven molecular dynamics to refine docking predictions and to score them according to a hydrogen-bond criterion. With this protocol, we were able to rank ligand affinities to HSA and to compare between the studied natural and artificial food additives. Our results show that the five artificial colorants studied bind better to HSA than their equivalent natural options, in terms of their H-bonding network, supporting the hypothesis of their potential risk to human health.

  abstract = {Cape Cameroon is a small, insular territory bordering the northern shore of the Wouri estuary in Cameroon. It is located in the 6th district of the city of Douala (1 907 479 inhabitants (BUCREP, 2010)), with Manoka as its capital. It is occupied by 2654 inhabitants. This territory is occupied mainly by a Nigerian ethnic group, and the Cameroonian sovereignty has been fighting in this Cameroonian territory since the 1998-2008 conflict with Nigeria on the Bakassi peninsula.Coastal erosion is very intense and affects populations and ecosystems. Sustainable development is a particular challenge in this insular territory because the population is confronted with important coastal erosion phenomena and that cannot migrate inland because of the Mabé swamp Natural Reserve. Since the beginning of the 2000s, coastal erosion has removed houses, infrastructures and a large part of the Mabé Reserve. This contribution aims to mobilize remote sensing and GIS tools and data to (1) map the different sequences of the coastline retreat in Cape Cameroon and highlight the main factors, and (2) map the mangrove degradation due to the inland motion of the anthropic pressure, and (3) make projection for future of this territory. For modeling the coastal kinematics, the mapping is based on the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) model, developed by Thieler et al. (2009). We used supervised classifications of Landsat images from the 1975, 1986, 2000 and 2018 with 30-meter resolution according to the maximum likelihood algorithm. We could thus assess the land use change and extract shorelines. Furthermore we use field observations, the testimonies of the people who lived for a long time along the shore to access if (1) erosion occurs continuously or during extreme events and if (2) mangrove degradation is linked to coastal erosion. Between 1986 and 2014, earth losses are estimated at more than 103 ha. Mangroves recorded a considerable degradation that the rate is estimate of 13.68\%. The improved quantification of coastal erosion (in terms of soil area loss), the human occupation and land degradation through time and its possible future evolution allow to address the specific challenge of closed restricted territories occupied by growing poor and marginalized population, and the long-term sustainability of a natural reserve in such environment.},

In this paper, we report the results of two deception studies whose goal was to better understand the critical relationship between Wikipedia and Google. These studies silently removed Wikipedia content from Google search results and examined the effect of doing so on participants’ interactions with both websites. Our findings demonstrate and characterize an extensive interdependence between Wikipedia and Google. Google becomes a worse search engine for many queries when it cannot surface Wikipedia content (e.g. click-through rates on results pages drop significantly) and the importance of Wikipedia content is likely greater than many improvements to search algorithms. Our results also highlight Google’s critical role in providing readership to Wikipedia. However, we also found evidence that this mutually beneficial relationship is in jeopardy: changes Google has made to its search results that involve directly surfacing Wikipedia content are significantly reducing traffic to Wikipedia. Overall, our findings argue that researchers and practitioners should give deeper consideration to the interdependence between peer production communities and the information technologies that use and surface their content.},

  abstract = {This paper criticizes the checklist model approach (authority, accuracy, objectivity, currency, coverage) to teaching undergraduates how to evaluate Web sites. The checklist model rests on faulty assumptions about the nature of information available through the Web, mistaken beliefs about student evaluation skills, and an exaggerated sense of librarian expertise in evaluating information. The checklist model is difficult to implement in practice and encourages a mechanistic way of evaluating that is at odds with critical thinking. A contextual approach is offered as an alternative. A contextual approach uses three techniques: promoting peer- and editorially-reviewed resources, comparison, and corroboration. The contextual approach promotes library resources, teaches information literacy, and encourages reasoned judgments of information quality.},

La compétence numérique est en fait une nécessité sociétale dont il faut prendre la mesure pour ne pas créer de nouvelles fractures. Quelques situations pédagogiques au postsecondaire permettent d’illustrer la façon dont la compétence numérique peut être abordée dans différentes matières.},

  abstract = {This article is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the role of dietary methods for treatment of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) when pharmacotherapy has proven unsatisfactory or unacceptable. Results of recent research and controlled studies, based on a PubMed search, are emphasized and compared with earlier reports. The recent increase of interest in this form of therapy for ADHD, and especially in the use of omega supplements, significance of iron deficiency, and the avoidance of the "Western pattern" diet, make the discussion timely. Diets to reduce symptoms associated with ADHD include sugar-restricted, additive/preservative-free, oligoantigenic/elimination, and fatty acid supplements. Omega-3 supplement is the latest dietary treatment with positive reports of efficacy, and interest in the additive-free diet of the 1970s is occasionally revived. A provocative report draws attention to the ADHD-associated "Western-style" diet, high in fat and refined sugars, and the ADHD-free "healthy" diet, containing fiber, folate, and omega-3 fatty acids. The literature on diets and ADHD, listed by PubMed, is reviewed with emphasis on recent controlled studies. Recommendations for the use of diets are based on current opinion of published reports and our practice experience. Indications for dietary therapy include medication failure, parental or patient preference, iron deficiency, and, when appropriate, change from an ADHD-linked Western diet to an ADHD-free healthy diet. Foods associated with ADHD to be avoided and those not linked with ADHD and preferred are listed. In practice, additive-free and oligoantigenic/elimination diets are time-consuming and disruptive to the household; they are indicated only in selected patients. Iron and zinc are supplemented in patients with known deficiencies; they may also enhance the effectiveness of stimulant therapy. In patients failing to respond or with parents opposed to medication, omega-3 supplements may warrant a trial. A greater attention to the education of parents and children in a healthy dietary pattern, omitting items shown to predispose to ADHD, is perhaps the most promising and practical complementary or alternative treatment of ADHD.},

Evidently, this coloring chemicals have their origin in natural products, which later expanded to the huge market of artificial food dyes. Artificial food colorings have been in the controversy for many years and scrutinized for being possibly linked to cancer, allergies and hyperactivity. Globally, natural as well as artificial dyes are being cautiously researched and regulated by the food safety authorities. In India, the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 (now called the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006), has been implemented for the quality assurance of various types of foods and food products, and only eight dyes have been suggested edible, but within prescribed limits. The present article explores the history and journey of these captivating materials which have been brightening our world for more than 3500 years, along with a detailed overview of their physical and chemical properties, and the usage and toxicity of the eight permissible food dyes in India.},

When patients have specific deficits in cognitive control functions (CCD), they are not  only distressing and debilitating, they often predict poor clinical outcomes such as  reduced response to SSRI/SNRI antidepressants, increased disability, suicide and  all-cause mortality. We recently reported that in an open label trial, our treatment  designed to target these specific CCD with neuroplasticity-based computerized  cognitive remediation (nCCR) improved depression and CCD in patients who failed to  remit with conventional antidepressant treatment. This study tested the hypothesis  that in patients with LLD who have failed at least one trial of an SSRI/SNRI  antidepressant at an adequate dose for at least 8 weeks, nCCR will improve both  depressive symptoms and the CCD associated with poor antidepressant response (i.e.  semantic strategy, inhibition of prepotent responses) more than an active control  group. Participants were randomized (1:1) to receive either 30 hours/ 4 weeks of  neuroplasticity based computerized cognitive remediation (nCCR) designed to target  CCD, or the active control condition matched for duration, engagement, reward,  computer presentation, and contact with study staff. All participants and raters  were blinded. Mixed effects model analysis the time effect (week) (F(1,71.22)=25.2,  p{$<$}0.0001) and treatment group X time interaction (F(1,61.8)=11.37, p=.002) reached  significance indicating that the slope of decline in MADRS was steeper in the  nCCR-GD group. Further, the nCCR group improved their semantic clustering  strategy(t(28)=9.5; p=.006), as well as performance on the Stroop interference  condition, and cognitive flexibility (Trails B). Further, results transferred to  memory performance, which was not a function trained by nCCR. clinicaltrials.gov.},

  abstract = {Prior research suggests that Twitter users in the United States are more politically engaged and more partisan compared to the American citizenry -- a public that is otherwise characterized by low levels of political knowledge and disinterest in political affairs. This study seeks to understand this disconnect by conducting an observational analysis of the most popular accounts on American Twitter. We identify opinion leaders by drawing a random sample of ordinary American Twitter users and observing whom they follow. We estimate the ideological leaning and political relevance of these opinion leaders as well as crowd-source how they are perceived by ordinary Americans. We find little evidence that American Twitter is as politicized as is made out to be, with politics and hard news outlets constituting a small subset of these opinion leaders. We find no evidence of polarization among these opinion leaders either. While certain professional categories such as political pundits and political figures are more polarized than others, the overall polarization dissipates further when we factor in the rate at which the opinion leaders tweet: a large number of vocal non-partisan opinion leaders drowns out the partisan voices on the platform. Our results suggest that the degree to which Twitter is political, has likely been overstated in the past. Our findings have implications about how we use Twitter to represent public opinion in the United States.},

Here we argue for the adoption of measures to optimize key elements of the scientific process: methods, reporting and dissemination, reproducibility, evaluation and incentives. There is some evidence from both simulations and empirical studies supporting the likely effectiveness of these measures, but their broad adoption by researchers, institutions, funders and journals will require iterative evaluation and improvement. We discuss the goals of these measures, and how they can be implemented, in the hope that this will facilitate action toward improving the transparency, reproducibility and efficiency of scientific research.},

  abstract = {The scientific consensus on human-caused global warming has been a topic of intense interest in recent decades. This is in part due to the important role of public perception of expert consensus, which has downstream impacts on public opinion and support for mitigation policies. Numerous studies, using diverse methodologies and measures of climate expertise, have quantified the scientific consensus, finding between 90\% and 100\% agreement on human-caused global warming with multiple studies converging on 97\% agreement. This study revisits the consensus among geoscientists ten years after an initial survey of experts, while exploring different ways to define expertise and the level of agreement among these groups. We sent 10 929 invitations to participate in our survey to a verified email list of geosciences faculty at reporting academic and research institutions and received 2780 responses. In addition to analyzing the raw survey results, we independently quantify how many publications self-identified climate experts published in the field of climate change research and compare that to their survey response on questions about climate change. As well as a binary approach classifying someone as ‘expert’ or ‘non-expert’, we also look at expertise as a scale. We find that agreement on anthropogenic global warming is high (91\% to 100\%) and generally increases with expertise. Out of a group of 153 independently confirmed climate experts, 98.7\% of those scientists indicated that the Earth is getting warmer mostly because of human activity such as burning fossil fuels. Among those with the highest level of expertise (independently confirmed climate experts who each published 20+ peer reviewed papers on climate change between 2015 and 2019) there was 100\% agreement that the Earth is warming mostly because of human activity.},

Processing speed was evaluated with prior prescription medication, without medication after a 2-day period off ADHD medication, and with low-dose (10/20mg) and high-dose (20/40mg) methylphenidate hydrochloride (Medikinet IR).Results: Thirty-three participants responded to the experimental treatments. One-way ANOVA with post-hoc analysis (Scheffe) indicated significant main effects for single dimension colour and form and dual-dimension colour-form naming. Post-hoc analysis indicated statistical differences between the no- and high-dose medication conditions for colour and form, measures of perceptual speed. For colour-form naming, a measure of cognitive speed, there was a significant difference between no- and low-dose medication and between no- and high-dose medications, but not between low- and high-dose medications.Conclusions: Results indicated that the AQT tests effectively monitored incremental effects of the methylphenidate dose on processing speed after a 2-day period off medication. Thus, perceptual (colour and form) and cognitive speed (two-dimensional colour-form naming) and processing efficiency (lowered shift costs) increased measurably with high-dose medication. These preliminary findings warrant validation with added measures of associated behavioural and cognitive changes.},

Results: At intake without medication, naming times (s) were significantly longer and overhead, CF - (C + F), larger than after stabilization of ADHD symptoms. Means for single-dimension naming were in the normal range, and for CF and overhead, means were in the atypical ranges. After treatment, CF and overhead improved to within normal ranges. On average, dual-dimension processing speed increased by 31\% and efficiency by 73\%. Sensitivity at intake was 91\%, using fail-criteria for CF and/or overhead. Conclusion: Results support previous estimates of sensitivity and ability to monitor pharmacological-treatment effects in ADHD. (J. of Att. Dis. 2013; 17(3)187-193)},

An estimated 8\% of children with ADHD may have symptoms related to synthetic food colors. CONCLUSIONS: A restriction diet benefits some children with ADHD. Effects of food colors were notable were but susceptible to publication bias or were derived from small, nongeneralizable samples. Renewed investigation of diet and ADHD is warranted.},

Previous studies have reached conflicting conclusions about the effects of exposure to counter-attitudinal information. As fact-checking has become more prominent, it is therefore worth examining how respondents respond to fact-checks of politicians—a question with important implications for understanding the effects of this journalistic format on elections. We present results to two experiments conducted during the 2016 campaign that test the effects of exposure to realistic journalistic fact-checks of claims made by Donald Trump during his convention speech and a general election debate. These messages improved the accuracy of respondents’ factual beliefs, even among his supporters, but had no measurable effect on attitudes toward Trump. These results suggest that journalistic fact-checks can reduce misperceptions but often have minimal effects on candidate evaluations or vote choice.},

  abstract = {Purpose Fruits and vegetables, being good source of energy, health promoting and protecting compounds with unique taste and flavor, are attracting consumers since ages. These horticultural produces start deterioration just after harvest; therefore, their proper storage is must during transportation and storage to retain maximum quality parameters and for good market value. Best storage conditions are required to prevent growth of micro flora and to maintain the nutritional values of harvested produce. Retailers and processors in every corner of world want to move toward the cheaper ways to increase the shelf life and texture of horticultural crops for better consumer preference. The purpose of this paper is to make consumers and researchers aware about different post harvest malpractices in fresh fruits and vegetables. Design/methodology/approach Lot of chemicals like colors, artificial ripening agents, sweeteners and waxes are applied on surface of horticulture produce to siphon off money from consumers, and these have adverse health effects directly or indirectly. Various regulatory agencies have launched various programs, acts and laws for monitoring and avoiding such unhealthy ways. Regulatory bodies launched training programs also for the food handlers and consumers to ensure the food safety from farm to fork. Findings This paper will throw light on different malpractices followed by retailers to manipulate the quality which causes adverse health effects and to create consumer awareness regarding such malpractices. Originality/value The paper emphasizes on current malpractices followed by retailers to mislead the consumers about fruits' and vegetable' quality by using sweeteners, colors and other chemical. On prolonged consumption, such substances lead to major health issues such as attention disorder.},

Ils sont peu ou pas diplômés et exercent des métiers qui ne demandent pas d'usage de l'informatique. Pourtant, ils se sont pleinement emparés d'internet et en ont fait un instrument de leur vie quotidienne. La recherche en ligne leur a ouvert un monde jusque-là hors de portée : elle leur permet de percer le mystère des termes médicaux, leur fournit des armes pour l'aide scolaire aux enfants, leur ouvre de nouvelles activités. Des biens et des services, auxquels il leur était impossible d'accéder avant dans ces zones rurales, sont à portée de clic, à des prix imbattables. Internet est aussi un lieu de parole et de réconfort : dans l'entre soi des comptes Facebook sont confiés aux proches les drames de la vie en milieu populaire - le célibat subi, la perte d'emploi, les incertitudes du travail précaire. Mais cette aventure a un coût. Ces outils, dont le potentiel d'individualisation est fort, fragilisent la vie collective familiale en multipliant les « moments à soi » entre conjoints et en rendant le contrôle de la sociabilité des enfants impossible. Les achats en ligne contribuent à détruire le petit commerce et à désertifier l'environnement immédiat. Les relations électroniques avec Pôle Emploi ou la CAF tournent souvent au cauchemar et transforment l'État providence en État tourmenteur. Fondée sur des entretiens et l'analyse approfondie de comptes Facebook, cette recherche sur les classes populaires non précaires, éclaire la tension constante entre ouverture et risque que représente la course à la modernité électronique.},

  abstract = {The amount of data generated by the current interconnected world is immeasurable, and a large part of such data is publicly available, which means that it is accessible by any user, at any time, from anywhere in the Internet. In this respect, Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is a type of intelligence that actually benefits from that open nature by collecting, processing and correlating points of the whole cyberspace to generate knowledge. In fact, recent advances in technology are causing OSINT to currently evolve at a dizzying rate, providing innovative data-driven and AI-powered applications for politics, economy or society, but also offering new lines of action against cyberthreats and cybercrime. The paper at hand describes the current state of OSINT and makes a comprehensive review of the paradigm, focusing on the services and techniques enhancing the cybersecurity field. On the one hand, we analyze the strong points of this methodology and propose numerous ways to apply it to cybersecurity. On the other hand, we cover the limitations when adopting it. Considering there is a lot left to explore in this ample field, we also enumerate some open challenges to be addressed in the future. Additionally, we study the role of OSINT in the public sphere of governments, which constitute an ideal landscape to exploit open data.},

  abstract = {Misinformation can amplify humanity's greatest challenges. A salient recent example of this is the COVID-19 pandemic, which has bred a multitude of falsehoods even as truth has increasingly become a matter of life-and-death. Here we investigate why people believe and spread false (and true) news content about COVID-19, and test an intervention intended to increase the truthfulness of the content people share on social media. Across two studies with over 1,600 participants (quota-matched to the American public on age, gender, ethnicity and geographic region), we find support for the idea that people share false claims about COVID-19 in part because they simply fail to think sufficiently about whether or not content is accurate when deciding what to share. In Study 1, participants were far worse at discerning between true and false content when deciding what they would share on social media relative to when they are asked directly about accuracy. Furthermore, participants who engaged in more analytic thinking and had greater science knowledge were more discerning in their belief and sharing. In Study 2, we found that a simple accuracy reminder at the beginning of the study – i.e., asking people to judge the accuracy of a non-COVID-19-related headline – more than doubled the level of truth discernment in participants’ sharing intentions. In the control, participants were equally like to say they would share false versus true headlines at COVID-19 whereas, in the treatment, sharing of true headlines was significantly higher than false headlines. Our results – which mirror those found previously for political fake news – suggest that nudging people to think about accuracy is a simple way to improve choices about what to share on social media. Accuracy nudges are straightforward for social media platforms to implement on top of the other approaches they are currently employing, and could have an immediate positive impact on stemming the tide of misinformation about the COVID-19 outbreak.},

  abstract = {What can be done to combat political misinformation? One prominent intervention involves attaching warnings to headlines of news stories that have been disputed by third-party fact-checkers. Here we demonstrate a hitherto unappreciated potential consequence of such a warning: an implied truth effect, whereby false headlines that fail to get tagged are considered validated and thus are seen as more accurate. With a formal model, we demonstrate that Bayesian belief updating can lead to such an implied truth effect. In Study 1 (n = 5,271 MTurkers), we find that although warnings do lead to a modest reduction in perceived accuracy of false headlines relative to a control condition (particularly for politically concordant headlines), we also observed the hypothesized implied truth effect: the presence of warnings caused untagged headlines to be seen as more accurate than in the control. In Study 2 (n = 1,568 MTurkers), we find the same effects in the context of decisions about which headlines to consider sharing on social media. We also find that attaching verifications to some true headlines—which removes the ambiguity about whether untagged headlines have not been checked or have been verified—eliminates, and in fact slightly reverses, the implied truth effect. Together these results contest theories of motivated reasoning while identifying a potential challenge for the policy of using warning tags to fight misinformation—a challenge that is particularly concerning given that it is much easier to produce misinformation than it is to debunk it.This paper was accepted by Elke Weber, judgment and decision making.},

  abstract = {Background/purpose Scoping review design represents a methodology that allows assessment of emerging evidence, as well as a first step in research development. Despite its increasing use, to date no article reflecting use of scoping review methodology has been submitted for review at JAANP. The purpose of this article is to provide detailed information on scoping reviews, including definition, related processes, and uses, and discuss the relationship to nurse practitioner (NP) practice, policy, education, and research. The longer-term goal is that NPs will understand the related techniques, consider the methodology as a viable one for NP scholarship, and bring related reports to the forefront of NP publications. Methods This manuscript represents a brief report. Processes to develop the brief include detailed search and review of scoping review literature in CINAHL and PubMed. Both methodologic reports and reviews were included. Definitions and uses of scoping reviews were reviewed. Conclusion The definition and process of scoping review are evolving. Although there is controversy regarding the methodology, there is increasing visibility of scoping review methodology in the published literature since the year 2000, with over 500 published reviews currently available. Implications for practice A well-executed scoping review has potential to inform NP practice, policy, education, and research.},

They gleefully whip the media into a frenzy over a fake teen drug crisis; they post offensive messages on Facebook memorial pages, traumatizing grief-stricken friends and family; they use unabashedly racist language and images. They take pleasure in ruining a complete stranger's day and find amusement in their victim's anguish. In short, trolling is the obstacle to a kinder, gentler Internet. To quote a famous Internet meme, trolling is why we can't have nice things online. Or at least that's what we have been led to believe. In this provocative book, Whitney Phillips argues that trolling, widely condemned as obscene and deviant, actually fits comfortably within the contemporary media landscape. Trolling may be obscene, but, Phillips argues, it isn't all that deviant. Trolls' actions are born of and fueled by culturally sanctioned impulses—which are just as damaging as the trolls' most disruptive behaviors. Phillips describes, for example, the relationship between trolling and sensationalist corporate media—pointing out that for trolls, exploitation is a leisure activity; for media, it's a business strategy. She shows how trolls, “the grimacing poster children for a socially networked world,” align with social media. And she documents how trolls, in addition to parroting media tropes, also offer a grotesque pantomime of dominant cultural tropes, including gendered notions of dominance and success and an ideology of entitlement. We don't just have a trolling problem, Phillips argues; we have a culture problem. This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things isn't only about trolls; it's about a culture in which trolls thrive.},

  abstract = {"Il est presque impossible aujourd'hui de trouver du travail, de s'inscrire à l'Université, ou de faire des démarches administratives sans disposer d'une adresse électronique ou faire usage des réseaux sociaux et des moteurs de recherche sur le Web. Les bibliothèques se sont rapidement positionnées pour accompagner ce tournant numérique en ouvrant des ateliers d'initiation à l'informatique, à l'Internet puis au numérique. Dans cet ouvrage, un collectif de chercheurs (sciences de l'éducation, sciences politiques, sociologie, anthropologie, etc.) et de bibliothécaires (lecture publique notamment) revient sur l'expérience des 'ateliers internet' et analyse l'apport spécifique des bibliothèques en France et à l'étranger dans la construction d'une culture numérique. Au-delà du thème de la fracture numérique, qui imposerait une ligne de partage entre les citoyens connectés et les autres, ces auteurs indiquent que les lignes de rupture sont plurielles ; les usagers qui prennent le chemin des 'ateliers internet' cherchent tout à la fois à faire face aux injonctions sociales de la société de l'information, à acquérir des savoir-faire qu'ils considèrent comme nécessaires mais aussi à se ressaisir comme individu compétent, intégré, reconnu. Ces ateliers en bibliothèque constituent des tiers-lieux essentiels, au cœur de la cité, où peut s'opérer une transition numérique entre des façons d'apprendre, de communiquer, de travailler, de se lier à l'autre et de faire société."

This 2007 survey found that only about one in three public high school biology teachers presented evolution consistently with the recommendations of the nation’s leading scientific authorities. And about 13\% of the teachers emphasized to their students that creationism was a valid scientific alternative to modern evolutionary biology. In this paper, we investigate how the quality of evolution teaching, as measured by teachers’ reports of their teaching practices with regard to evolution and creationism, has changed in the intervening 12~years.},

Ce wiki fait partie d’un cours en ligne à l’Université TÉLUQ. Il peut être consulté à l’adresse suivante : http://wiki.teluq.ca/ted6210/index.php/Bienvenue\_dans\_Wiki-TEDia. Le projet Wiki-TEDia s’inscrit dans la démarche SoTL soutenue par la méthodologie de la recherche-design. Il se trouve actuellement au début de l’étape de l’évaluation de la première phase de l’itération prévue. Cette première phase s’est déroulée entre 2012 et 2018. La première année a été consacrée à l’idéation et la conception du wiki dans le cadre d’un cours en ligne de 2e cycle. Les cinq années suivantes, le wiki a été ouvert aux étudiants du cours et à tous les employés et les étudiants de la TÉLUQ.   Dans ce chapitre, je présente d’abord quelques considérations théoriques sur les usages des wikis en enseignement supérieur en général, et, en formation à distance en particulier. Par la suite, je décris la première phase du projet,  principalement l’inspiration théorique, l’idéation et la conception du wiki. Une fois démarré, le contenu de Wiki-TEDia a été construit et amélioré progressivement par 124 étudiants du cours dont il fait partie. Ces étudiants ont démontré non seulement leur implication dans leurs études, mais aussi leur professionnalisme en participant à l’élaboration des connaissances utiles pour les professionnels de l’éducation . Sans leur participation, je n’aurai évidemment pas pu progresser dans la réflexion sur ma pratique d’enseignement avec le wiki, dont je dresse les contours dans la conclusion de ce chapitre.},

Seniors suffering from  depression (SSDs) on the other hand show EF-related deficiencies; however, there is  hardly any literature available regarding their relationship with FI in Latin SSDs,  who usually have low ELs. OBJECTIVE: To verify the relationship between EFs and FI  in SSDs of Latin origins, by controlling the effects associated with age and  educational level. METHODOLOGY: Cross-sectional study, of cases and controls,  conducted on a nonprobability sample, made up of 102 self-sufficient SSDs and 142  control subjects over age 50, monolinguals of Latin origin (Chileans), all assessed  by means of a battery of assessments such as: Geriatric Depression Scale,  Addenbrook's Cognitive Assessment III, Trail making Tests A and B, STROOP word-color  test, and semantic and phonological verbal fluency tests. A domain of composite EFs  was established with standardized Chilean population scores, where age and  educational levels were controlled. A simple linear regression analysis was  conducted to determine the relationship between EFs and FI in SSDs. RESULTS: Upon  controlling age and educational levels, EFs explained an FI variance of 3.9\% in  SSDs; depression explained an EF variance of 3.2\%, and 3.7\% of FI. CONCLUSION: The  results of the present study highlight the importance of a timely intervention when  it comes to geriatric depression, considering the negative effect it has over the  executive functions and the functionality of seniors.},

Yet, large-scale applications of PBM have been hampered by the high amounts of inoculum per plant or per cultivation area needed for successful colonization and consequently the economic feasibility. Seed coating, a process that consists in covering seeds with low amounts of exogenous materials, is gaining attention as an efficient delivery system for PBM. Microbial seed coating comprises the use of a binder, in some cases a filler, mixed with inocula, and can be done using simple mixing equipment (e.g., cement mixer) or more specialized/sophisticated apparatus (e.g., fluidized bed). Binders/fillers can be used to extend microbial survival. The most reported types of seed coating are seed dressing, film coating, and pelleting. Tested in more than 50 plant species with seeds of different dimensions, forms, textures, and germination types (e.g., cereals, vegetables, fruits, pulses, and other legumes), seed coating has been studied using various species of plant growth-promoting bacteria, rhizobia, Trichoderma, and to a lesser extent mycorrhizal fungi. Most of the studies regarding PBM applied via seed coating are aimed at promoting crop growth, yield, and crop protection against pathogens. Studies have shown that coating seeds with PBM can assist crops in improving seedling establishment and germination or achieving high yields and food quality, under reduced chemical fertilization. The right combination of biological control agents applied via seed coating can be a powerful tool against a wide number of diseases and pathogens. Less frequently, studies report seed coating being used for adaptation and protection of crops under abiotic stresses. Notwithstanding the promising results, there are still challenges mainly related with the scaling up from the laboratory to the field and proper formulation, including efficient microbial combinations and coating materials that can result in extended shelf-life of both seeds and coated PBM. These limitations need to be addressed and overcome in order to allow a wider use of seed coating as a cost-effective delivery method for PBM in sustainable agricultural systems.},

Methods             Published and preprint randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing IVM effects on COVID-19 adult patients were searched until March 15, 2021 in five engines. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, length of stay (LOS), and adverse events (AE). Secondary outcomes included viral clearance and severe AEs. We evaluated risk of bias (RoB) using the Cochrane RoB 2·0 tool. Inverse variance random effect meta-analyses were performed with quality of evidence (QoE) evaluated using GRADE methodology. Subgroup analyses by severity of disease and RoB, and sensitivity analyses by time of follow-up were conducted.                                   Results             Ten RCTs (n=1173) were included. Controls were standard of care [SOC] in five RCTs and placebo in five RCTs. RCTs sample size ranged from 24 to 398 patients, mean age from 26 to 56 years-old, and severity of COVID-19 disease was mild in 8 RCTs, moderate in one RCT, and mild and moderate in one RCT. IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality vs. controls (RR 0.37, 95\%CI 0.12 to 1.13, very low QoE). IVM did not reduce LOS vs. controls (MD 0.72 days, 95\%CI -0.86 to 2.29, very low QoE). AEs, severe AE and viral clearance were similar between IVM and controls (low QoE for these three outcomes). Subgroups by severity of COVID-19 or RoB were mostly consistent with main analyses; all-cause mortality in three RCTs at high RoB was reduced with IVM. Sensitivity analyses excluding RCTs with follow up {$<$}21 days showed no difference in all-cause mortality.                                   Conclusions             In comparison to SOC or placebo, IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality, length of stay or viral clearance in RCTs in COVID-19 patients with mostly mild disease. IVM did not have effect on AEs or SAEs. IVM is not a viable option to treat COVID-19 patients.},

To help counter this, we developed a ‘fake news game’ in which participants are actively tasked with creating a news article about a strongly politicized issue (the European refugee crisis) using misleading tactics, from the perspective of different types of fake news producers. To pilot test the efficacy of the game, we conducted a randomized field study (N = 95) in a public high school setting. Results provide some preliminary evidence that playing the fake news game reduced the perceived reliability and persuasiveness of fake news articles. Overall, these findings suggest that educational games may be a promising vehicle to inoculate the public against fake news.},

In a novel attempt to address this issue, we designed a psychological intervention in the form of an online browser game. In the game, players take on the role of a fake news producer and learn to master six documented techniques commonly used in the production of misinformation: polarisation, invoking emotions, spreading conspiracy theories, trolling people online, deflecting blame, and impersonating fake accounts. The game draws on an inoculation metaphor, where preemptively exposing, warning, and familiarising people with the strategies used in the production of fake news helps confer cognitive immunity when exposed to real misinformation. We conducted a large-scale evaluation of the game with N\,=\,15,000 participants in a pre-post gameplay design. We provide initial evidence that people’s ability to spot and resist misinformation improves after gameplay, irrespective of education, age, political ideology, and cognitive style.},

  abstract = {The recent explosion of “fake news” highlights the need for academic libraries to provide access to reliable information resources and for librarians to instruct students in using them effectively. Providing reliable resources with minimal barriers to access involves cooperation among librarians, publishers, and vendors; however, I suggest that there is tension between our mutual desires to satisfy student demands for instant and perfect results and to encourage them to become persistent and critical information seekers. Many tools exist to assist students in gaining background information and limiting search results, but ultimately none replace the need to develop and explore questions and to evaluate information sources. In this paper, I reflect on the difficulties of persuading students to persist in using library resources and the use of Bernard Lonergan’s generalized empirical method as a framework for critical thinking and information literacy.},

  abstract = {Un phénomène impensable est en train de se produire : l’agonie du néolibéralisme. Tous ses excès – et la crise du covid – ont confirmé sa nocivité. Nous nous mettons alors à espérer un monde plus juste qui adviendrait grâce au retour de l’État providence, à la prise en compte des questions écologiques et à une participation citoyenne accrue. Un véritable paysage de carte postale en somme. Or, rien de cela ne nous sauvera du pouvoir des algorithmes, de la marchandisation intégrale de nos vies par l’industrie numérique, ou du déploiement d’une télésocialité contribuant à notre « isolement collectif ». Autant de processus qui engendrent de nouveaux types d’assujettissement, ignorés de la « grande politique ». Si nous savons que l’enjeu majeur de notre époque est d’être partie prenante des affaires qui nous regardent, cette aspiration prend des formes trop éparses, ne répondant à aucun projet commun défini en ce sens. À contre-courant de cette tendance, ce livre renouvelle les perspectives d’émancipation, en dressant un registre d’actions concrètes. Cela suppose de mener une critique des discours défendant des intérêts privés, de ne plus subir de situations iniques et de constituer un foisonnement de collectifs – dans tous les domaines de la vie – favorisant l’expérimentation, la meilleure expression de chacun, tout en étant soucieux de ne léser ni personne, ni la biosphère. Après tant de désillusions, le moment est venu de ne plus nous en remettre à des instances tierces pour nous engager dans une impérieuse et salutaire politique de nous-mêmes. (4e de couverture)},

  abstract = {The E number system for food additives was introduced in the 1960s and the E was intended to reassure consumers that permitted additives were safe. In the 1980s full ingredient declarations had to be provided on food products for the first time and manufacturers were permitted to use either the name or the number of the additive on the ingredient list. This paper outlines some of the trends in the sourcing, use and labelling of additives since the introduction of full ingredient listing. Generally, sourcing has become more global with a large number of suppliers being based in China. From an initial use of E numbers in ingredient lists, manufacturers are increasingly using the names of additives. This trend is being extended to avoid the use of anything the consumer might consider an additive, particularly in connection with colours and preservatives. Specifically, the colours used in the Southampton study on the impact of food colours on hyperactivity in children have largely been replaced by colouring foodstuffs, and the preservative used in the study, sodium benzoate, has been replaced by potassium sorbate in the majority of soft drinks.

  abstract = {We add richness and depth to investor decision-making research by exploring the influence of entrepreneurs' use of ingratiation rhetoric in their investor pitch presentations on investor funding decisions. Drawing on ingratiation theory, we model the effects of flattery, self-deprecation, opinion conformity, and self-promotion as distinct forms of ingratiation rhetoric. We do so independently and in tandem, conceptualizing the confluence of ingratiation forms as driving an overall aggregate effect on the amount of funding allocated by investors. We then theorize that entrepreneur charisma and entrepreneur performance are moderators of the aggregate effect. We test our model in the angel investment context with data from 789 entrepreneur pitch presentations to 27 investors on the Shark Tank television program from 2009 through 2020. We find that on their own, the different forms of ingratiation rhetoric have mixed effects, with flattery and self-deprecation negatively impacting investor funding amount and opinion conformity and self-promotion positively relating to funding amount. When used together, we find an overall negative effect, and this effect is positively moderated by entrepreneur charisma and entrepreneur performance. These findings shed new light on ingratiation rhetoric as a powerful force in entrepreneurs' efforts to secure funding.},

  abstract = {In the framework of the Canaries‐Iberian marine ecosystem Exchanges (CAIBEX) experiment, an interdisciplinary high‐resolution survey was conducted in the NW African region of Cape Ghir (30°38′N) during August 2009. The anatomy of a major filament is investigated on scales down to the submesoscale using in situ and remotely sensed data. The filament may be viewed as a system composed of three intimately connected structures: a small, shallow, and cold filament embedded within a larger, deeper, and cool filament and an intrathermocline anticyclonic eddy (ITE). The cold filament, which stretches 110 km offshore, is a shallow feature 60 m deep and 25 km wide, identified by minimal surface temperatures and rich in chlorophyll a. This structure comprises two asymmetrical submesoscale (∼18 km) fronts with jets flowing in opposite directions. The cold filament is embedded near the equatorward boundary of a much broader region of approximately 120 km width and 150 m depth that forms the cool filament and stretches at least 200 km offshore. This cool region, partly resulting from the influence of cold filament, is limited by two asymmetrical mesoscale (∼50 km) frontal boundaries. At the ITE, located north of the cold filament, we observe evidence of downwelling as indicated by a relatively high concentration of particles extending from the surface to more than 200 m depth. We hypothesize that this ITE may act as a sink of carbon and thus the filament system may serve dual roles of offshore carbon export and carbon sink. ; Peer reviewed},

  abstract = {Alongside the growing concerns regarding predatory journal growth, other questionable editorial practices have gained visibility recently. Among them, we explored the usefulness of the Percentage of Papers by the Most Prolific author (PPMP) and the Gini index (level of inequality in the distribution of authorship among authors) as tools to identify journals that may show favoritism in accepting articles by specific authors. We examined whether the PPMP, complemented by the Gini index, could be useful for identifying cases of potential editorial bias, using all articles in a sample of 5,468 biomedical journals indexed in the National Library of Medicine. For articles published between 2015 and 2019, the median PPMP was 2.9\%, and 5\% of journal exhibited a PPMP of 10.6\% or more. Among the journals with the highest PPMP or Gini index values, where a few authors were responsible for a disproportionate number of publications, a random sample was manually examined, revealing that the most prolific author was part of the editorial board in 60 cases (61\%). The papers by the most prolific authors were more likely to be accepted for publication within 3 weeks of their submission. Results of analysis on a subset of articles, excluding nonresearch articles, were consistent with those of the principal analysis. In most journals, publications are distributed across a large number of authors. Our results reveal a subset of journals where a few authors, often members of the editorial board, were responsible for a disproportionate number of publications. To enhance trust in their practices, journals need to be transparent about their editorial and peer review practices.},

This paper offers to discuss how people learn to use the wheelchairs, how they move with them, and how the chair influences their inclusion. Based on an eighteen-month ethnography in a Coloured township in Cape Town (South Africa), such a reading of the wheelchair calls for a relational and intersectional approach of citizenship. Defined broadly as one's relationship to their body, their environment, their relatives, and the State, citizenship is experienced through a web of social, institutional, and material relationships. This approach ultimately raises issues of inclusion, belonging, and stigmatisation. After presenting the context of the research, I discuss the notions of active citizenship, modern citizenship and the right to the city. The conclusion comes back to the ideas of relational and intersectional citizenship as a way forward for research in disability studies and in South Africa. (English)},

  abstract = {This surprising study of online political mobilization shows that money and organizational sophistication influence politics online as much as off, and casts doubt on the democratizing power of digital activism.The internet has been hailed as a leveling force that is reshaping activism. From the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street to Black Lives Matter and \#MeToo, digital activism seemed cheap, fast, and open to all. Now this celebratory narrative finds itself competing with an increasingly sinister story as platforms like Facebook and Twitter―once the darlings of digital democracy―are on the defensive for their role in promoting fake news. While hashtag activism captures headlines, conservative digital activism is proving more effective on the ground.In this sharp-eyed and counterintuitive study, Jen Schradie shows how the web has become another weapon in the arsenal of the powerful. She zeroes in on workers’ rights advocacy in North Carolina and finds a case study with broad implications. North Carolina’s hard-right turn in the early 2010s should have alerted political analysts to the web’s antidemocratic potential: amid booming online organizing, one of the country’s most closely contested states elected the most conservative government in North Carolina’s history.The Revolution That Wasn’t identifies the reasons behind this previously undiagnosed digital-activism gap. Large hierarchical political organizations with professional staff can amplify their digital impact, while horizontally organized volunteer groups tend to be less effective at translating online goodwill into meaningful action. Not only does technology fail to level the playing field, it tilts it further, so that only the most sophisticated and well-funded players can compete.},

Ce manuel propose une introduction à la programmation Python destinée aux étudiants et praticiens en SHS. Python est un langage de programmation simple, libre, multi-plateforme, pédagogique, bénéficiant d'une communauté d'utilisateurs croissante tant dans le domaine universitaire que le secteur privé. Avec la multiplication des données numériques dans les sciences humaines et sociales (SHS), le recours à l'informatique devient indispensable tant pour la collecte, la mise en forme, ou le traitement des données. Le langage Python permet à la fois de réaliser les traitements statistiques habituels des SHS tout en ouvrant aux nouveaux usages liés à l'automatisation des tâches informatiques, le traitement des grands corpus des humanités numériques ou encore la collecte de données sur les réseaux sociaux. Ce manuel se concentre en priorité sur les usages du traitement des données en SHS. Complété avec de nombreux exemples de code et des études de cas concrets, l'ouvrage permet une familiarisation progressive à la programmation, au langage Python et à sa philosophie. Il insiste sur sa flexibilité pour répondre aux besoins de chaque problématique tout en soulignant l'importance de la diffusion et de la reproductibilité des traitements informatiques (4e de couverture.)},

Yet, a few previous reports demonstrated an antimicrobial activity of ibuprofen as well, although none investigated its direct effects on the pathogens found in the CF lung, which is the focus of this work. Determination of ibuprofen's in vitro antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia species strains through measurements of the endpoint number of CFU and growth kinetics showed that ibuprofen reduced the growth rate and bacterial burden of the tested strains in a dose-dependent fashion. In an in vitroPseudomonas biofilm model, a reduction in the rate of biomass accumulation over 8 h of growth with ibuprofen treatment was observed. Next, an acute Pseudomonas pneumonia model was used to test this antimicrobial activity after the oral delivery of ibuprofen. Following intranasal inoculation, ibuprofen-treated mice exhibited lower CFU counts and improved survival compared with the control animals. Preliminary biodistribution studies performed after the delivery of ibuprofen to mice by aerosol demonstrated a rapid accumulation of ibuprofen in serum and minimum retention in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Therefore, ibuprofen-encapsulated polymeric nanoparticles (Ibu-NPs) were formulated to improve the pharmacokinetic profile. Ibu-NPs formulated for aerosol delivery inhibited the growth of P. aeruginosa in vitro and may provide a convenient dosing method. These results provide an additional explanation for the previously observed therapeutic effects of ibuprofen in CF patients and further strengthen the argument for its use by these patients.},

Loneliness is also associated with impaired executive control functioning (ECF)  including multiple cognitive subdomains, such as working memory, planning, response  inhibition, and attention control. However, little knowledge exists as to whether  perceived loneliness is associated with impaired functioning of specific ECF  components. The relationship between perceived loneliness and the latent dimensions  capturing multiple measures across different ECF paradigms has not been established.  In this study, we first investigated the latent dimensions of ECF processes across a  comprehensive range of paradigms using exploratory factor analysis. We then examined  the association of perceived loneliness and the resulted ECF components in older  adults while simultaneously controlling for other demographic and affective  measures. Four components emerged from the factor analysis: social cognition and  processing speed, planning and working memory, selective, divided attention and  inhibition control, and sustained attention and motor inhibition. We observed that  the second ECF component, planning and working memory, was a significant predictor  of perceived loneliness even after controlling for depressive characteristics  measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale. Our findings have potential clinical  significance in the older population, by showing that planning and working memory  functions may predict perceived loneliness, which is also associated with higher  risk for major depression. Thus, older individuals who have lower planning and  working memory functions may be specifically targeted for possible early prevention  of chronic loneliness and depression.},

  abstract = {In debates over diagnoses of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and use of the drug Ritalin among the American school age population, discussion often centers around who is to blame for rising diagnoses and increasing use of Ritalin. Parents have come under particular scrutiny by critics who associate ADHD behaviors in children with poor parenting and view Ritalin as a “quick-fix” for socially situated problems. Biologically oriented researchers of ADHD, on the other hand have posited organically based dysfunction as the cause of ADHD behaviors. This paper explores the problem of blame in relation to ADHD diagnoses and Ritalin use from the perspective of mothers of boys with ADHD. Qualitative interviews with mothers suggest that medicalization of problematic behaviors in young boys includes an inherent narrative of blame transformation; this transformation can be expressed as a binarism: mother-blame–brain-blame. The first two sections of the paper document mothers’ experiences of blame for their sons’ symptomatic behaviors against the background of a cultural mothering ideology. The third section considers the promise of absolution from mother-blame inherent in the transformative binary structure. I argue that medicalization of boys’ problem behaviors supports and reconstitutes the potential for mother-blame and does little to pierce oppressive cultural mothering ideals.},

  abstract = {While LIS scholarship emphasizes the need to be multi-literate by equipping people with critical information literacy, digital literacy, and media literacy skills to combat the phenomenon of fake news in the contemporary information society, the concept of political information literacy is still in its infancy. This chapter addresses this gap by developing an understanding of political information literacy and challenges the premise that information professionals and information organizations should remain neutral in the face of phenomena like censorship through noise and disinformation. In this endeavor, it reviews contemporary information environments vis-à-vis the growth of fake news and misinformation, and current information literacy approaches utilized by information organizations. Thereafter, it explores several cognitive barriers, such as the role of confirmation bias, information avoidance, information groupishness, and information overload, which affects people’s ability to process information. Finally, it encourages information professionals to hold regular information sessions on politically charged topics, tackle the cognitive factors increasing misinformation, and cultivate multidisciplinary approaches to confront fake news.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The occurrence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has significantly increased in the last few years. One of the common problems in this group are eating disorders and ailments from the gastrointestinal systems. According to some studies, these problems have a significant impact on the occurrence and severity of symptoms in the neurological system, so it is crucial to increase the attention paid on the role of diet in the treatment of this disease. One of the theories connects ASD with disorders of the digestive system and the intestinal bacterial flora. This theory is based on the gut-brain axis, which means the interaction between the gastrointestinal and nervous systems. Objectives: To demonstrate the differences in behavior habits, interest in nutrition, and frequency of consumption of food products between children suffering from ASD and healthy children. Materials and methods: The study was conducted among 44 children suffering from ASD and 33 healthy children as a control group. Data were collected using a questionnaire that was specially designed for this study. The questionnaire contained questions about eating habits and the frequency of consumption of selected food products. Results: Parents of healthy children showed more interest in their children's way of feeding and nutritional recommendations compared to parents of children with ASD (4\% and 11.3\%, respectively). In addition, 24.3\% more children with ASD consulted with a nutritionist compared to the control group. Complaints of the digestive system were 21.1\% more likely by children with ASD. Children suffering from ASD were characterized by a higher intake of red meat and giblets and less frequent consumption of milk and milk products compared to the control group. There were no statistically significant differences between the study group and the control group in terms of frequency of consumption of products, which are the source of gluten, artificial food additives-preservatives, and artificial colors. Conclusions: There are differences in the habits and eating behaviors and the frequency of consumption of selected food products between a group of children with ASD and a group of healthy children.},

The authors undertook meta-analyses of the efficacy of dietary (restricted elimination diets, artificial food color exclusions, and free fatty acid supplementation) and psychological (cognitive training, neurofeedback, and behavioral interventions) ADHD treatments. METHOD: Using a common systematic search and a rigorous coding and data extraction strategy across domains, the authors searched electronic databases to identify published randomized controlled trials that involved individuals who were diagnosed with ADHD (or who met a validated cutoff on a recognized rating scale) and that included an ADHD outcome. RESULTS: Fifty-four of the 2,904 nonduplicate screened records were included in the analyses. Two different analyses were performed. When the outcome measure was based on ADHD assessments by raters closest to the therapeutic setting, all dietary (standardized mean differences=0.21-0.48) and psychological (standardized mean differences=0.40-0.64) treatments produced statistically significant effects. However, when the best probably blinded assessment was employed, effects remained significant for free fatty acid supplementation (standardized mean difference=0.16) and artificial food color exclusion (standardized mean difference=0.42) but were substantially attenuated to nonsignificant levels for other treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Free fatty acid supplementation produced small but significant reductions in ADHD symptoms even with probably blinded assessments, although the clinical significance of these effects remains to be determined. Artificial food color exclusion produced larger effects but often in individuals selected for food sensitivities. Better evidence for efficacy from blinded assessments is required for behavioral interventions, neurofeedback, cognitive training, and restricted elimination diets before they can be supported as treatments for core ADHD symptoms.},

Dans "Saison brune", Philippe Squarzoni tisse un récit inédit, qui entremêle analyses scientifiques et interviews de spécialistes, considérations personnelles et hommages au cinéma, enquête politique et essai engagé. Le livre est découpé en six chapitres. Les deux premiers chapitres sont consacrés aux aspects scientifiques du réchauffement : le fonctionnement du climat, la description de l'effet de serre, l'augmentation des gaz à effet de serre dans l'atmosphère durant l'époque moderne. Mais aussi l'expertise menée par le GIEC, l'attribution du réchauffement aux activités humaines, les différents scénarios d'augmentation des températures à venir, les risques d'effets de seuil, les risques de rétroactions positives. Dans les deux chapitres suivants, Philippe Squarzoni alterne entre l'examen des conséquences à venir du réchauffement climatique (fonte des glaciers, montée des eaux, multiplication des tempêtes, risques de sécheresse dans certaines régions...) et les questionnements du narrateur et de sa compagne face à cette situation inédite.Dans les deux derniers chapitres, Squarzoni élargit son questionnement et examine les possibilités de réduction des émissions et les différents scénarios énergétiques qui s'offrent à nos sociétés (énergies renouvelables, nucléaire, progrès technologiques, maîtrise de l'énergie...). Entre les insuffisances des unes, et les faux espoirs des autres, il décrit une alternative possible qui permettrait d'éviter les conséquences les plus graves du réchauffement climatique. Et les choix politiques, les modèles de société, que ces scénarios impliquent.},

Exactly how they might leverage that trust remains unclear and untested. Building on recent work in correcting health misperceptions on social media, this study tests whether libraries can leverage trust to combat misinformation online. Using a misperception about the influenza vaccine as a test case, an experiment (n\,=\,625) was conducted in fall 2018 using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Results suggest that the misperception can be reduced, but not by library institutions. An unsuccessful follow-up (n\,=\,600) suggests that the effectiveness of the correction is season dependent and opens the possibility that libraries may yet play a role, but not necessarily because they are trusted. Future library proposals for combating misinformation need to be developed and tested within a broader contemporary misinformation research program.},

The response from the profession has been to reaffirm the core values of librarianship and to hold up traditional services as a means for combating misinformation. The problem is that these solutions are offered in the absence of a full understanding of the real danger of misinformation, which is “not just [that] misinformation is ‘out there,’” but “what misinformation does to our mind” (Ecker, 2015: 22). Misinformation research in other fields directly challenges the solutions proposed by library professionals and casts doubts on their underlying assumptions. This article provides an overview of the library and information science approach to misinformation in the United States, discusses the shortcomings of that approach, and points to possible next steps for remedying the problem.},

  abstract = {Jeffrey Beall, a US librarian, coined the term “predatory publishing” specifically to describe a movement or phenomenon of open access (OA) journals and publishers that he and others believed displayed exploitative and unscholarly principles. Using a blog to transmit those ideas, and profiling specific cases using blacklists, one of the most polemic aspects of Beall's blog was its tendency to attract and incite academic radicalism. Beall targeted both publishers and standalone journals, but how he precisely determined that an OA journal or a publisher was predatory was in many cases an ambiguity. Beall's deficient and highly subjective criteria, as well as those blacklists' incapacity to clearly distinguish low quality OA publishers from predatory ones, may have negatively impacted the operations of several Beall-blacklisted OA journals and publishers. Freedom of speech that embraces prejudice, via Beall's blog, and the establishment of “predatory” blacklists, are enhanced discriminatory ideologies that continue to be carried downstream from Beall to and by other like-minded individuals and groups who proliferate academic divisiveness and may also be formalizing and institutionalizing a culture of discriminative philosophies by cloning Beall's blacklists and encouraging their continued use.},

En janvier dernier, je publiais À la trace, une cartographie que j'espérais complète des acteurs et des enjeux de la surveillance contemporaine. Quelques mois plus tard, l'épidémie de Covid-19 offrait, à l'échelle mondiale, un cas d'usage frappant des dispositifs que je m'étais efforcé de décrire.On a vu des officines de toutes tailles, hier positionnées sur le juteux secteur de la sécurité, pivoter vers un nouvel impératif, celui de la traque des corps malades – un levier encore plus puissant que la lutte contre le terrorisme. Des applications de traçage, de "suivi des contacts', ont été développées un peu partout, misant sur le numérique pour endiguer la course du virus. Dans le ciel, des drones sortis d'un futur proche ont fait respecter le confinement. On a confié à des caméras le soin de s'assurer du port du masque et du respect de la distanciation sociale.La crise sanitaire a mis au jour la présence de ces dispositifs de surveillance toujours plus nombreux, dont elle a dans le même temps assis la légitimité et accéléré la banalisation. On me demande souvent s'il faut craindre la généralisation d'une surveillance dite de masse ; et s'il s'agissait plutôt d'une massification de la surveillance ? "Olivier Tesquet},

Additionally, this study argues that, within academic libraries, the practice of critical information literacy, a pedagogical approach aligned with the concept of resistant spectatorship, is an ideal mode for encouraging students to become resistant readers of information in its increasingly corporate-mediated forms.},

  abstract = {Purpose/Thesis: The article focuses on digital wisdom, defined by Marc Prensky as the ability to use modern computer technology wisely to improve thinking and decision-making and to better share the results of research. The aim of this article is to present some of the digital tools that increase the efficiency of scientific research and facilitate conceptual work, information retrieval, note-taking and writing up of research.  Approach/Methods: The research process comprised several stages, each of which focused on a specific tool that directly increases work efficiency and performs functions beyond human capabilities.  Results and conclusions: The latest digital tools are equipped with features that increase efficiency at all stages of the research process. They speed up the completion of a task (e.g. searching for information) and illuminate the relationships between documents or individual concepts that researchers themselves would not register (e.g. through the visualization of data and information).  Originality/Value: The skillful use of modern digital tools is a fundamental element of digital wisdom as computer programs and Web applications significantly broaden human perception and cognitive capabilities.},

  abstract = {Objective Attention Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Chronic Tic Disorder (CTD) are two common and frequently co-existing disorders, probably following an additive model. But this is not yet clear for the basic sensory function of colour processing sensitive to dopaminergic functioning in the retina and higher cognitive functions like attention and interference control. The latter two reflect important aspects for psychoeducation and behavioural treatment approaches. Methods Colour discrimination using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue Test, sustained attention during the Frankfurt Attention Inventory (FAIR), and interference liability during Colour- and Counting-Stroop-Tests were assessed to further clarify the cognitive profile of the co-existence of ADHD and CTD. Altogether 69 children were classified into four groups: ADHD (N = 14), CTD (N = 20), ADHD+CTD (N = 20) and healthy Controls (N = 15) and compared in cognitive functioning in a 2x2-factorial statistical model. Results Difficulties with colour discrimination were associated with both ADHD and CTD factors following an additive model, but in ADHD these difficulties tended to be more pronounced on the blue-yellow axis. Attention problems were characteristic for ADHD but not CTD. Interference load was significant in both Colour-and Counting-Stroop-Tests and unrelated to colour discrimination. Compared to Controls, interference load in the Colour-Stroop was higher in pure ADHD and in pure CTD, but not in ADHD+CTD, following a sub-additive model. In contrast, interference load in the Counting-Stroop did not reveal ADHD or CTD effects. Conclusion The co-existence of ADHD and CTD is characterized by additive as well as sub-additive performance impairments, suggesting that their co-existence may show simple additive characteristics of both disorders or a more complex interaction, depending on demand. The equivocal findings on interference control may indicate limited validity of the Stroop-Paradigm for clinical assessments.},

Results:The study populations were generally small and the studies varied in duration and nature of the exposure. Overall 10 out of 12 studies spoke in favour of an elimination diet, 2 out of 6 of eliminating artificial food colourings from the diet and none in favour of eliminating sucrose or aspartame from the diet to treat ADHD. Conclusion:The current evidence is not enough to recommend treating ADHD with diet interventions, but a subgroup of children and adolescents might warrant from elimination of certain food-items. Further investigations of the mechanism and effect of diet interventions to treat ADHD is needed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Major depressive episode (MDE) is worldwide one of the most prevalent and disabling mental health conditions. In cases of persistent non-response to  treatment, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a safe and effective treatment  strategy with high response rates. Unfortunately, longitudinal data show low  sustained response rates with 6-month relapse rates as high as 50\% using existing  relapse prevention strategies. Cognitive side effects of ECT, even though transient,  might trigger mechanisms that increase relapse in patients who initially responded  to ECT. Among these side effects, reduced cognitive control is an important  neurobiological driven vulnerability factor for depression. As such, cognitive  control training (CCT) holds promise as a non-pharmacological strategy to improve  long-term effects of ECT (i.e., increase remission, and reduce depression relapse).  METHOD/DESIGN: Eighty-eight patients aged between 18 and 70\,years with MDE who start  CCT will be included in this randomized controlled trial (RCT). Following (partial)  response to ECT treatment (at least a 25\% reduction of clinical symptoms), patients  will be randomly assigned to a computer based CCT or active placebo control. A first  aim of this RCT is to assess the effects of CCT compared to an active placebo  condition on depression symptomatology, cognitive complaints, and quality of life.  Secondly, we will monitor patients every 2~weeks for a period of 6~months following  CCT/active placebo, allowing the detection of potential relapse of depression.  Thirdly, we will assess patient evaluation of the addition of cognitive remediation  to ECT using qualitative interview methods (satisfaction, acceptability and  appropriateness). Finally, in order to further advance our understanding of the  mechanisms underlying effects of CCT, exploratory analyses will be conducted using  video footage collected during the CCT/active control phase of the study.  DISCUSSION: Cognitive remediation will be performed following response to ECT, and  an extensive follow-up period will be employed. Positive findings would not only  benefit patients by decreasing relapse, but also by increasing acceptability of ECT,  reducing the burden of cognitive side-effects. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study is  registered with ClinicalTrials.gov . Study ID: NCT04383509 Trial registration date:  12.05.2020.},

  abstract = {Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) etiology is not completely understood, but common comorbid dysfunction of the gastrointestinal and immune system suggests that these systems may be affected by a common genetic background and molecular mechanisms. For example, increased levels of specific cytokines were observed in ADHD. Moreover, ADHD has a high comorbidity with both Th1- and Th2-mediated disorders like ear infections, eczema and asthma. A common pathophysiological mechanism was suggested to underlie both asthma and ADHD, while several genes that are linked to ADHD have immune functions. Furthermore, immunological recognition of food provoking ADHD-like behavior was suggested. An immune imbalance, probably requiring a predisposing genetic background, is therefore suggested to contribute to ADHD etiology, with immune dysregulation being more likely than a single subcellular defect. However, next to allergic mechanisms, also pharmacological mechanisms (especially in case of food additives) might be involved. In addition, though cellular (cytokine-related) rather than antibody-mediated immune mechanisms seem involved, specific immune-inflammatory markers other than antibodies have not been systematically studied in ADHD. Substantial alterations implicated in ADHD apparently occur in the immune system and epigenetic regulation of gene expression. As a result, chronic inflammation and oxidative stress could develop, which can lead to ADHD symptoms, for example by chronic T-cell-mediated neuroinflammation. If immune pathways contribute to ADHD, both its diagnosis and treatment should be reconsidered. Modulation of immune system activity might have potential in ADHD treatment, for example by nutritional approaches providing safe and low-cost ADHD therapy, but further research in these fields is implicated.},

  abstract = {La maladie de Parkinson représente une atteinte particulière du système nerveux central, caractérisée par un dysfonctionnement chronique des noyaux gris centraux, dont le rôle est essentiel dans le contrôle de l'exécution des plans moteurs appris. Sa physiopathologie provoque une rigidité générale des muscles, des tremblements (surtout des membres) et une difficulté à démarrer les séquences motrices. Outre un ralentissement général des mouvements (bradykinésie) ses conséquences sur les muscles du conduit vocal et du larynx sont aggravées par un manque de sensations proprioceptives de la langue et de la mandibule provoqué par l'atteinte des ganglions de la base. Les troubles de la production de parole au cours de la maladie de Parkinson constituent un des marqueurs cliniques représentatifs de l'évolution du handicap moteur à l'instar d'autres activités motrices complexes comme les troubles de l'équilibre et de la marche. Les troubles de la parole pénalisent particulièrement l'autonomie des patients en détériorant leur capacité de communication au cours de l'évolution de la maladie La caractéristique principale des troubles de la production vocale observés au cours de la maladie de Parkinson est une dysarthrie qualifiée d'hypokinétique, ce terme faisant non seulement référence à la réduction des mouvements articulatoires mais aussi à la diminution de la modulation prosodique de la parole par ailleurs qualifiée de monotone.On constate au cours de la maladie une progression « caudo-rostrale » des troubles du conduit vocal, débutant au niveau laryngé pour atteindre ensuite la partie postérieure de la constriction linguo-palatine, puis sa partie antérieure et enfin la constriction bilabiale.La précession d'une dysphonie et de la dysprosodie est rapportée d'une manière générale chez les patients parkinsoniens avec handicap moteur faible et indépendants dans leur vie quotidienne. Les anomalies observées globalement sont une réduction d'intensité, une monotonie et un débit ralenti que l'on peut définir plus précisément par la diminution d'énergie du signal vocal, la réduction de variabilité de la hauteur (dynamique de la Fo) et l'augmentation du nombre de pauses « non remplies ». Comme elle apparaît dés les premières atteintes de la maladie, l'insuffisance prosodique constitue probablement la marque la plus spécifique des troubles de la parole dans la maladie de Parkinson.Apparaissent ensuite, des atteintes articulatoires qui dégradent progressivement l'intelligibilité.Outre l'imprécision des consonnes, déviance assez peu spécifique puisqu'elle est présente dans toutes les dysarthries, les anomalies articulatoires dans la maladie de Parkinson portent essentiellement sur les consonnes occlusives, lesquelles sont perçues comme des constrictives, témoignant d'une fermeture insuffisante du conduit vocal.Pour les voyelles, la tendance à la réduction de la surface du triangle vocalique rapportée chez les patients parkinsoniens peut rendre compte de la dédifférenciation des voyelles, ce qui contribue avec les phénomènes de spirantisation et de coarticulation à la réduction des contrastes acoustiques. L'image d'une trajectoire évolutive globale des troubles de la parole au cours de la maladie de Parkinson ne doit pas faire oublier la très grande variabilité interindividuelle du phénotype et de tenir compte de la problématique générale de reproductibilité des observations et des enregistrements chez un patient donné.},

  abstract = {Policies ensuring that research data are available on public archives are increasingly being implemented at the government [1], funding agency [2, 3, 4], and journal [5, 6] level. These policies are predicated on the idea that authors are poor stewards of their data, particularly over the long term [7], and indeed many studies have found that authors are often unable or unwilling to share their data [8, 9, 10, 11]. However, there are no systematic estimates of how the availability of research data changes with time since publication. We therefore requested data sets from a relatively homogenous set of 516 articles published between 2 and 22 years ago, and found that availability of the data was strongly affected by article age. For papers where the authors gave the status of their data, the odds of a data set being extant fell by 17\% per year. In addition, the odds that we could find a working e-mail address for the first, last, or corresponding author fell by 7\% per year. Our results reinforce the notion that, in the long term, research data cannot be reliably preserved by individual researchers, and further demonstrate the urgent need for policies mandating data sharing via public archives.},

  abstract = {Artificial food dyes are made from petroleum and have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the enhancement of the color of processed foods. They are widely used in the food and pharmaceutical industries to increase the appeal and acceptability of their products. Synthetic food colorants can achieve hues not possible for natural colorants and are cheaper, more easily available, and last longer. However, since the use of artificial food coloring has become widespread, many allergic and other immune reactive disorders have increasingly been reported. During the past 50 y, the amount of synthetic dye used in foods has increased by 500\%. Simultaneously, an alarming rise has occurred in behavioral problems in children, such as aggression, attention deficit disorder (ADD), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The ingestion of food delivers the greatest foreign antigenic load that challenges the immune system. Artificial colors can also be absorbed via the skin through cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. The molecules of synthetic colorants are small, and the immune system finds it difficult to defend the body against them. They can also bond to food or body proteins and, thus, are able to act in stealth mode to circumvent and disrupt the immune system. The consumption of synthetic food colors, and their ability to bind with body proteins, can have significant immunological consequences. This consumption can activate the inflammatory cascade, can result in the induction of intestinal permeability to large antigenic molecules, and could lead to cross-reactivities, autoimmunities, and even neurobehavioral disorders. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recently found a 41\% increase in diagnoses of ADHD in boys of high-school age during the past decade. More shocking is the legal amount of artificial colorants allowed by the FDA in the foods, drugs, and cosmetics that we consume and use every day. The consuming public is largely unaware of the perilous truth behind the deceptive allure of artificial color.},

However, our ability to measure the social makeup of online communities and in turn, to understand the social organization of online platforms, is limited by the pseudonymous, unstructured and large-scale nature of digital discussion. Here we develop a neural-embedding methodology to quantify the positioning of online communities along social dimensions by leveraging large-scale patterns of aggregate behaviour. Applying our methodology to 5.1 billion comments made in 10,000 communities over 14 years on Reddit, we measure how the macroscale community structure is organized with respect to age, gender and US~political partisanship. Examining political content, we find that Reddit underwent a significant polarization event around the 2016 US~presidential election. Contrary to conventional wisdom, however, individual-level polarization is rare; the system-level shift in 2016 was disproportionately driven by the arrival of new users. Political polarization on Reddit is unrelated to previous activity on the platform and is instead temporally aligned with external events. We also observe a stark ideological asymmetry, with the sharp increase in polarization in 2016 being entirely attributable to changes in right-wing activity. This methodology is broadly applicable to the study of online interaction, and our findings have implications for the design of online platforms, understanding the social contexts of online behaviour, and quantifying the dynamics and mechanisms of online polarization.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The proposition that synthetic food colors can induce adverse behavioral effects in children was first enunciated in 1975 by Feingold [Why Your Child Is Hyperactive. New York:Random House (1975)], who asserted that elevated sensitivity to food additives underlies the signs of hyperactivity observed in some children. Although the evidence suggested that some unknown proportion of children did respond to synthetic food colors, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) interpreted the evidence as inconclusive. A study published in 2007 [McCann et al. Food additives and hyperactive behaviour in 3-year-old and 8/9-year-old children in the community: a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Lancet 370:1560-1567 (2007)] drew renewed attention to the hypothesis because of the study's size and scope. It led the FDA to review the evidence, hold a public hearing, and seek the advice of its Food Advisory Committee. In preparation for the hearing, the FDA reviewed the available evidence and concluded that it did not warrant further agency action. OBJECTIVES: In this commentary I examine the basis of the FDA's position, the elements of the review that led to its decision and that of the Food Advisory Committee, and the reasons that this is an environmental health issue. DISCUSSION: The FDA review confined itself, in essence, to the clinical diagnosis of hyperactivity, as did the charge to the committee, rather than asking the broader environmental question of behavioral effects in the general population; it failed to recognize the significance of vulnerable subpopulations; and it misinterpreted the meaning of effect size as a criterion of risk. The FDA's response would have benefited from adopting the viewpoints and perspectives common to environmental health research. At the same time, the food color debate offers a lesson to environmental health researchers; namely, too narrow a focus on a single outcome or criterion can be misleading.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The proposition that synthetic food colors can induce adverse behavioral effects in children was first enunciated in 1975 by Feingold [Why Your Child Is Hyperactive. New York:Random House (1975)], who asserted that elevated sensitivity to food additives underlies the signs of hyperactivity observed in some children. Although the evidence suggested that some unknown proportion of children did respond to synthetic food colors, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) interpreted the evidence as inconclusive. A study published in 2007 [McCann et al. Food additives and hyperactive behaviour in 3-year-old and 8/9-year-old children in the community: a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Lancet 370:1560-1567 (2007)] drew renewed attention to the hypothesis because of the study's size and scope. It led the FDA to review the evidence, hold a public hearing, and seek the advice of its Food Advisory Committee. In preparation for the hearing, the FDA reviewed the available evidence and concluded that it did not warrant further agency action. OBJECTIVES: In this commentary I examine the basis of the FDA's position, the elements of the review that led to its decision and that of the Food Advisory Committee, and the reasons that this is an environmental health issue. DISCUSSION: The FDA review confined itself, in essence, to the clinical diagnosis of hyperactivity, as did the charge to the committee, rather than asking the broader environmental question of behavioral effects in the general population; it failed to recognize the significance of vulnerable subpopulations; and it misinterpreted the meaning of effect size as a criterion of risk. The FDA's response would have benefited from adopting the viewpoints and perspectives common to environmental health research. At the same time, the food color debate offers a lesson to environmental health researchers; namely, too narrow a focus on a single outcome or criterion can be misleading.},

Belief ‘choice’ is subject to an important constraint, however: people can only bring themselves to believe things for which they can find rationalizations. When preferences for similar beliefs are widespread, this constraint generates rationalization markets, social structures in which agents compete to produce rationalizations in exchange for money and social rewards. I explore the nature of such markets, I draw on political media to illustrate their characteristics and behaviour, and I highlight their implications for understanding motivated cognition and misinformation.},

Despite mounting attention to the problem of online misinformation and growing agreement that digital literacy efforts are important, prior research offers few concrete ideas about what skilled evaluations look like. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: Our purpose in this study was to seek out those who are skilled in online evaluations in order to understand how their strategies and approaches to evaluating digital content might inform educational efforts. We sampled 45 experienced users of the Internet: 10 Ph.D. historians, 10 professional fact checkers, and 25 Stanford University undergraduates. Analysis focused on the strategies participants used to evaluate online information and arrive at judgments of credibility. Research Design: In this expert/novice study, participants thought aloud as they evaluated live websites and searched for information on social and political issues such as bullying, minimum wage, and teacher tenure. We analyze and present findings from three of the tasks participants completed. Findings/Results: Historians and students often fell victim to easily manipulated features of websites, such as official-looking logos and domain names. They read vertically, staying within a website to evaluate its reliability. In contrast, fact checkers read laterally, leaving a site after a quick scan and opening up new browser tabs in order to judge the credibility of the original site. Compared to the other groups, fact checkers arrived at more warranted conclusions in a fraction of the time. Conclusions/Recommendations: We draw on insights gleaned from the fact checkers' practices to examine current curricular approaches to teaching web credibility as well as to suggest alternatives.},

Nous nous savons tous exposés aux mêmes risques : changement climatique, crise économique et écologique, épidémies, terrorismes, etc. Mais alors qu’elle s’impose dans les consciences, l’unité de l’humanité recule dans les représentations : revendications identitaires, nationalismes, xénophobies, radicalités religieuses. L’universel est accusé de toutes parts : il serait oublieux des particularismes et des différences, en somme il serait trop universel. Ou il ne le serait pas assez, il ne serait que le masque du plus fort : du patriarcat (tous les hommes, mais pas les femmes), de l’Occident (tous les hommes, mais seulement les Blancs), ou de l’anthropocentrisme (tous les hommes, mais pas les animaux). Contre ces replis, il faut que les idées universalistes retrouvent leur puissance mobilisatrice et critique. Contre la dictature des émotions et des opinions, défendre la raison scientifique. Contre l’empire des identités, refonder une éthique de l’égalité et de la réciprocité. Sur quoi peut aujourd’hui reposer cet héritage des Lumières ? Ni sur un Dieu, ni sur la Nature, car ils prouvent tout et son contraire. Il faut s’y résoudre : l’humanité est seule source de valeurs. Pour autant, nous ne sommes pas condamnés au relativisme. Car l’humanité, ce n’est pas seulement l’ensemble des êtres humains, c’est aussi la qualité présente en chacun de nous et qui nous lie aux autres : non pas la capacité de communiquer qui est aussi propre à d’autres espèces, ni l’aptitude à raisonner que possèdent certaines machines, mais la faculté de raisonner en communiquant, autrement dit de dialoguer.

The controversy was initiated by a scientific article about bacteria able to substitute arsenic for phosphorus in its genetic material. We present the debate chronologically, using prominent online media to reconstruct the events. Using tweets that discussed the controversy, we conducted quantitative sentiment analysis to examine skeptical and non-skeptical tones on Twitter. Critiques of and studies refuting the arsenic life hypothesis were publicized on blogs before formal publication in traditional academic spaces and were shared on Twitter, influencing issue salience among a range of audiences. This case exemplifies the role of new media in informal post-publication peer review, which can complement traditional peer review processes. The implications drawn from this case study for future conduct and transparency of both formal and informal peer review are discussed.},

  abstract = {Même s'il ne s'agit pas d'un biopic, Don’t Look Up est probablement la première grande œuvre cinématographique sur Trump. Par un va-et-vient entre la fiction et la réalité, le film amène à reconsidérer ses comportements autrement que par l’indifférence, le mépris ou la lassitude. Sans jamais laisser tranquille son spectateur, produisant même un malaise continu devant la bêtise de l’espèce humaine, notre bêtise, Adam McKay cherche désespérément à créer un sursaut dans les esprits face à la catastrophe écologique imminente.},

  abstract = {A new gas chromatographic method has been developed for the simultaneous determination of ibuprofen and paracetamol in bulk and pharmaceutical dosage form, using a TRB-5 column (30m in length, 0.25mm-ID and 0.25m-DF) and nitrogen as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1ml.min-1. The oven temperature was programmed at 180°C for 0.5min, with a rise of 15°C up to 250°C. The injector and detector temperature was 300°C. Detection was carried out using Flame Ionization Detector (FID). Methyl paraben was used as an internal standard. The retention times of ibuprofen and paracetamol were (3.681 and 4.089) min respectively. The validation of the method including linearity, range, accuracy, precision, system suitability and robustness was carried out utilizing ICH guidelines. Calibration curves were linear over the range (0.25-1.75)mg/mL for both ibuprofen and paracetamol. The percentage of accuracy for two drugs was found within the acceptance limit of (98–102)\%. The precision study results of the new method were less than the maximum allowable limit percentage of relative standard deviation (\%RSD) ≤ 2.0\%. The proposed method can be easily adopted for the routine analysis of ibuprofen and paracetamol in bulk and pharmaceutical dosage form.},

  abstract = {As people’s health awareness and standard of living improve, mHealth applications are being increasingly used. However, mHealth application services are mainly based on the collection of personal and behavioral data, which conflicts with users’ growing privacy concerns. In that context, this study considers the privacy paradox phenomenon, in which privacy concerns co-exist with disclosure behavior. This study explores the privacy paradox in mHealth applications using an integrated elaboration likelihood model (ELM) from the perspective of privacy calculus and privacy fatigue. Results from the quasi-experiment and partial least squares structural equation modeling reveal that, compared with privacy concerns, perceived benefits have a greater impact on users’ disclosure intention, which further supports the existence of the privacy paradox in the mHealth context; this process is found to originate in users’ privacy calculus. However, privacy fatigue is found to have an insignificant impact on users’ disclosure intention, which may be due to the low sunk cost of users’ investment in mHealth applications. The results indicate that designers of mHealth applications should optimize their interaction functions to enhance benefits to users.},

  abstract = {Scientists hypothesized that drugs such as ibuprofen or renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers could exacerbate the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 by upregulating the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which serves as an entry receptor for the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. This hypothesis was taken up by the lay press and led to concerns among doctors and patients whether the use of these drugs was still safe and justified against the background of the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2 with an increasing number of cases and deaths. In this article, we summarize what is known about the effect of RAS blockers or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on the course of COVID-19 disease. In the case of RAS inhibition, we also find evidence for the opposite hypothesis, namely, that RAS inhibition in COVID-19 could be protective. In view of the inconsistent and limited evidence and after weighing up the benefits and risks, we would not currently recommend discontinuing or switching an effective treatment with RAS blockers. NSAIDs should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible period. The choice of drug to treat COVID-19-associated fever or pain should be based on a benefit-risk assessment for known side effects (e.g., kidney damage, gastrointestinal ulceration).},
