This article summarizes the available empirical evidence on the impact of instruction on the development and enhancement of critical thinking skills and dispositions and student achievement. The review includes 341 effects sizes drawn from quasi- or true-experimental studies that used standardized measures of CT as outcome variables. The weighted random effects mean effect size (g+) was 0.30 (p {$<$} .001). The collection was heterogeneous (p {$<$} .001). Results demonstrate that there are effective strategies for teaching CT skills, both generic and content specific, and CT dispositions, at all educational levels and across all disciplinary areas. Notably, the opportunity for dialogue, the exposure of students to authentic or situated problems and examples, and mentoring had positive effects on CT skills.},

Patients with type 2  diabetes (n=26) and patients with diabetes and major depression (n=26) were compared  with healthy controls (n=20). Gray matter thickness across the entire cortex was  measured using cortical pattern matching methods. All subjects with diabetes  demonstrated decreased cortical gray matter thickness in the left anterior cingulate  region. Additionally, depressed diabetic subjects showed significant cortical gray  matter decreases in bilateral prefrontal areas compared with healthy controls.  Correlations between clinical variables and cortical gray matter thickness revealed  a significant negative relationship with cerebrovascular risk factors across all  three groups, most consistently in the left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. A  significant positive relationship between performance on attention and executive  function tasks and cortical gray matter thickness predominantly in left hemisphere  regions was also seen across all subjects. Depression and diabetes are associated  with significant cortical gray matter thinning in medial prefrontal areas.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder is associated with very high recurrence rates, and specific vulnerability factors that increase the risk for repeated episodes  should be identified. Impaired executive functions have repeatedly been found in  remitted populations. The current study included both neutral and emotional  executive tasks, and we expected to find impaired performance in unmedicated  previously depressed women compared to controls. Furthermore, we hypothesized that  the executive functions inhibition and shifting would be related to the ability to  apply cognitive reappraisal and to avoid unhealthy rumination. METHODS: Inhibition  and shifting data derived from neutral and emotional computerized tasks, and  questionnaire data on emotion regulation and trait rumination, were obtained from  previously depressed (n = 109) and never-depressed women (n = 64) and analyzed in  independent samples t-tests. A logistic regression analysis investigated the ability  of emotion regulation and rumination to predict depression vulnerability. The  associations of executive functions to emotion regulation and rumination were  investigated in a series of linear regression analyses. Participants on psychotropic  medication were excluded from all analyses of executive performance. RESULTS:  Previously depressed participants, the majority of which had experienced recurrent  episodes, matched control participants on both neutral and emotional executive  tasks. However, significantly more rumination and expressive suppression, and less  cognitive reappraisal, were found in the previously depressed group. Executive  function was unrelated to rumination and emotion regulation in this sample.  CONCLUSIONS: Previously depressed women whose executive function was intact were  characterized by ruminative tendencies and more frequent use of expressive  suppression. Trait rumination and expressive suppression are known to increase  depression risk, but were unrelated to executive functions in this population. This  indicates that unhealthy emotion regulation strategies may be targeted directly in  preventive interventions.},

  abstract = {While celebrity messaging is thought to be important in the design of public health campaigns, there is little work (a) decomposing the extent to which celebrity endorsement relies on directly authoring the content as opposed to passing on messages of others, (b) measuring how much explicitly citing public health authorities matters, and (c) examining whether these online messages are meaningfully received and digested offline. We address these three questions by conducting a large-scale randomized trial in Indonesia in 2015-2016, in which 46 high profile celebrities agreed to tweet or retweet messages promoting immunization. The decomposition shows that public health messages are 72\% more likely to be passed on when a celebrity is involved, but importantly, almost all of the effect (79\%) comes only when the celebrity authors the message themselves. Explicitly citing an external medical authority reduces the passing-on rate by 27\%. The results suggest that celebrities have an outsize influence in shaping public opinion on public health, particularly when they speak in their own voice.},

In general, artificial colorants have lower cost and better stability than the natural ones. Nevertheless, studies have reported their association with some health disorders. Furthermore, consumers have given greater attention to food products with health beneficial effects, which has provided a new perspective for the use of natural colorants. In this context, fruits are an excellent alternative source of natural compounds, that allow the obtainment of a wide range of colorant molecules, such as anthocyanins, betalains, carotenoids, and chlorophylls. Furthermore, in addition to their coloring ability, they comprise different bioactive properties. However, the extraction and application of natural colorants from fruits is still a challenge, since these compounds show some stability problems, in addition to issues related to the sustainability of raw-materials providing. To overcome these limitations, several studies have reported optimized extraction and stabilization procedures. In this review, the major pigments found in fruits and their extraction and stabilization techniques for uses as food additives will be looked over.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Executive processes consist of at least two sets of functions: one concerned with cognitive control and the other with reward-related decision making.  Abnormal performance in both sets occurs in late-life depression. This study tested  the hypothesis that only abnormal performance in cognitive control tasks predicts  poor outcomes of late-life depression treated with escitalopram. METHOD: We studied  older subjects with major depression (N = 53) and non-depressed subjects (N = 30).  Executive functions were tested with the Iowa Gambling Test (IGT), Stroop Color-Word  Test, Tower of London (ToL), and Dementia Rating Scale - Initiation/Perseveration  domain (DRS-IP). After a 2-week placebo washout, depressed subjects received  escitalopram (target daily dose: 20 mg) for 12 weeks. RESULTS: There were no  significant differences between depressed and non-depressed subjects on executive  function tests. Hierarchical cluster analysis of depressed subjects identified a  Cognitive Control cluster (abnormal Stroop, ToL, DRS-IP), a Reward-Related cluster  (IGT), and an Executively Unimpaired cluster. Decline in depression was greater in  the Executively Unimpaired (t = -2.09, df = 331, p = 0.0375) and the Reward-Related  (t = -2.33, df = 331, p = 0.0202) clusters than the Cognitive Control cluster. The  Executively Unimpaired cluster (t = 2.17, df = 331, p = 0.03) and the Reward-Related  cluster (t = 2.03, df = 331, p = 0.0433) had a higher probability of remission than  the Cognitive Control cluster. CONCLUSIONS: Dysfunction of cognitive control  functions, but not reward-related decision making, may influence the decline of  symptoms and the probability of remission of late-life depression treated with  escitalopram. If replicated, simple to administer cognitive control tests may be  used to select depressed older patients at risk for poor outcomes to selective  serotonin reuptake inhibitors who may require structured psychotherapy.},

METHODS: Engage assumes that abnormal function of the positive valence systems fuels  depression and uses "reward exposure" (engagement in meaningful, rewarding  activities) as its principal intervention. Negativity bias, apathy, and emotional  dysregulation are expressions of abnormalities in the negative valence, arousal and  regulatory, and cognitive control systems, respectively. Engage targets each of them  with simple interventions only if they interfere with reward exposure. We treated  openly, with 9 weekly sessions of Engage, 39 older adults with unipolar major  depression. We compared their course of depression (HAM-D), remission rate  (HAM-D{$<$}10), and disability (WHODAS) with those of a historical comparison group (N =  97) treated with 9 weekly sessions of PST. RESULTS: Community social workers and  research therapists required one third as much training time in Engage as in PST.  Engage was non-inferior to PST in reducing HAM-D and WHODAS. Remission rates for  Engage at 6 and 9 weeks were 18.2\% and 41.1\%, respectively. The corresponding  figures for PST were 13.7\% and 35.0\%, respectively. CONCLUSION: These initial  observations suggest that Engage has comparable efficacy with PST in reducing  depressive symptoms and disability and warrants a randomized controlled trial.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Abnormalities have been identified in the Cognitive Control Network (CCN) and the Default Mode Network (DMN) during episodes of late-life depression.  This study examined whether functional connectivity at rest (FC) within these  networks characterizes late-life depression and predicts antidepressant response.  METHODS: 26 non-demented, non-MCI older adults were studied. Of these, 16 had major  depression and 10 had no psychopathology. Depressed patients were treated with  escitalopram (target dose 20 mg) for 12 weeks after a 2-week placebo phase. Resting  state time series was determined prior to treatment. FC within the CCN was  determined by placing seeds in the dACC and the DLPFC bilaterally. FC within the DMN  was assessed from a seed placed in the posterior cingulate. RESULTS: Low resting FC  within the CCN and high resting FC within the DMN distinguished depressed from  normal elderly subjects. Beyond this "double dissociation", low resting FC within  the CCN predicted low remission rate and persistence of depressive symptoms and  signs, apathy, and dysexecutive behavior after treatment with escitalopram. In  contrast, resting FC within the DMN was correlated with pessimism but did not  predict treatment response. CONCLUSIONS: If confirmed, these findings may serve as a  signature of the brain's functional topography characterizing late-life depression  and sustaining its symptoms. By identifying the network abnormalities underlying  biologically meaningful characteristics (apathy, dysexecutive behavior, pessimism)  and sustaining late-life depression, these findings can provide a novel target on  which new somatic and psychosocial treatments can be tested.},

  abstract = {Depression predisposes to medical illnesses and advances biological aging indicated by shorter telomere length, accelerated brain aging and advanced epigenetic aging.  Medical illnesses also increase the risk of late-life depression. The reciprocal  relationships of depression with aging-related and disease-related processes have  generated pathogenetic hypotheses and provided treatment targets. Targeting risk  factors of vascular disease in mid-life is a logical approach in prevention of  vascular depression. The depression-executive dysfunction and the vascular  depression syndromes have clinical presentations and neuroimaging findings  consistent with frontostriatal abnormalities. Dopamine D(2/3) agonists are effective  in depression of Parkinson's disease and their efficacy needs to be assessed in  these two syndromes. Computerized cognitive remediation targeting functions of the  cognitive control network may improve both executive functions and depressive  symptoms of late-life major depression. Significant progress has been made in  neurostimulation treatments in depressed younger adults. TMS targeting deep  structures responsible for mood regulation is well tolerated by older adults and its  efficacy in syndromes of late-life depression needs to be studied. Efficacious  psychotherapies for late-life depression exist, but are underutilized in part  because of their complexity. Streamlined, stepped psychotherapies targeting  behaviors assumed to result from dysfunction of brain networks implicated in  late-life depression can be easy to learn and have potential for dissemination.  However, their effectiveness needs further investigation. Depression increases the  risk of dementing disorders. Antidepressants are rather ineffective in treating  depression of demented patients, but long-term use of antidepressants may reduce the  risk of dementia. However, confirmation studies are needed.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Older patients with depression and executive dysfunction represent a population with significant disability and a high likelihood of failing  pharmacotherapy. OBJECTIVES: To examine whether problem-solving therapy (PST)  reduces disability more than does supportive therapy (ST) in older patients with  depression and executive dysfunction and whether this effect is mediated by  improvement in depressive symptoms. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING:  Weill Cornell Medical College and University of California at San Francisco.  PARTICIPANTS: Adults (aged {$>$}59 years) with major depression and executive  dysfunction recruited between December 2002 and November 2007 and followed up for 36  weeks. Intervention Twelve sessions of PST modified for older depressed adults with  executive impairment or ST. Main Outcome Measure Disability as quantified using the  12-item World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule II. RESULTS: Of 653  individuals referred to this study, 221 met the inclusion criteria and were  randomized to receive PST or ST. Both PST and ST led to comparable improvement in  disability in the first 6 weeks of treatment, but a more prominent reduction was  noted in PST participants at weeks 9 and 12. The difference between PST and ST was  greater in patients with greater cognitive impairment and more previous episodes.  Reduction in disability paralleled reduction in depressive symptoms. The therapeutic  advantage of PST over ST in reducing depression was, in part, due to greater  reduction in disability by PST. Although disability increased during the 24 weeks  after the end of treatment, the advantage of PST over ST was retained. CONCLUSIONS:  These results suggest that PST is more effective than ST in reducing disability in  older patients with major depression and executive dysfunction, and its benefits  were retained after the end of treatment. The clinical value of this finding is that  PST may be a treatment alternative in an older patient population likely to be  resistant to pharmacotherapy.

Traits measured were number of eggs collected, egg weight, amount of feed taken from the feed troughs, body weight gain, fertility of eggs, feather pecking and comb damage scores, leukocyte count, plasma corticosterone level, and adrenal gland weight. During the 2-month experimental period, blind hens produced 12.7\% more eggs (hen-day production) while requiring 44.1 g less feed per bird per day compared to sighted hens. There was no significant difference in body weight gained between the two genotypes. Significant genotype × flock size and genotype × density interactions also indicated that the performance of the blind chickens was less affected by differences in density and flock size compared with sighted chickens. Other traits measured provided evidence that the blind chickens were less active, had better feather coverage, and were perhaps under less stress than sighted ones.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Cerebral hypoperfusion is common in heart failure (HF) and believed to underlie poor neurocognitive outcomes in this population. Up to 42\% of HF patients  also exhibit depressive symptomatology that may stem from reduced cerebral blood  flow. However, no study has examined this possibility or whether reduced brain  perfusion increases risk for future cognitive dysfunction in older adults with HF.  METHODS: One hundred HF patients underwent transcranial Doppler ultrasonagraphy to  quantify global cerebral blood flow velocity (CBF-V) and were administered a  cognitive test battery to assess global cognition, attention/executive function, and  memory abilities. All participants then completed the Beck Depression Inventory-II  to assess depressive symptomatology. These procedures were performed at baseline and  at 12-month follow-up. RESULTS: Repeated measures revealed that CBF-V declined over  the 12-month period. Regression analyses showed that reduced baseline CBF-V  predicted worse performances in attention/executive function (p\,{$<$}\,0.05 for all) and  a trend for memory (p\,=\,0.09) in addition to greater depressive symptomatology  (p\,{$<$}\,0.05) at the 12-month follow-up, even after controlling for baseline factors  and medical and demographic variables. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral perfusion declined over  time and was associated with poorer cognitive function and greater depressive  symptoms at a 1-year follow-up in HF. Prospective studies with long-term follow-ups  that employ neuroimaging are needed to examine whether cognitive dysfunction and  depression in HF stem from the adverse effects of cerebral hypoperfusion on the  cerebral structure.},

Drawing on research questioning the use of big data in social science and reception studies, we identify six misconceptions about misinformation and examine the conceptual and methodological challenges they raise. The first three misconceptions concern the prevalence and circulation of misinformation. First, the internet is not rife with misinformation or news, but with memes and entertaining content. Second, scientists focused on social media because it is methodologically convenient, but misinformation is not just a social media problem. Third, falsehoods don’t spread faster than the truth, how we define (mis)information influences our results and their practical implications. The second three misconceptions concern the impact and the reception of misinformation. First, people don’t believe everything they see on the internet: sheer volume of engagement should not be conflated with belief. Second, misinformation’s influence on people’s behavior is overblown since it often preaches to the choir. Third, people are more likely to be uninformed than misinformed, surveys overestimate misperceptions and say little about the causal influence of misinformation. To appropriately understand and fight misinformation, future research needs to address these challenges.},

  abstract = {Parental child-related spending represents an important pathway to promote children’s human capital development and material well-being. It is also, however, a pathway that perpetuates social inequalities given the well-known socioeconomic divide in parental spending on children. Although several studies have documented the extent to which current family income is associated with spending on children, we still know little about the causal effects of additional income on child-related spending across the socioeconomic strata. In this paper, I examine the effects of income gains due to universal and unconditional cash transfers from the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend on child-related spending. Using longitudinal household expenditure data from the 1996–2015 Consumer Expenditure Surveys, I exploit exogenous variation in the generosity of the Alaska Dividend to estimate short- and long-term disparities in parental expenditures resulting from payouts. Results provide a unique opportunity to compare the behavior of high- and low-income parents after an income boost. I find that low- and middle-income parents use cash transfers to catch up with their more affluent counterparts in the short and long term. Low-income parents are, however, unable to keep up with the long-term increases in child-related spending made by their middle-income counterparts. Implications of results for the reproduction of socioeconomic inequalities and for current and proposed cash-transfer policies are discussed.},

To identify the neuroanatomical substrate of LLAD, we examined  event-related fMRI data collected in eight subjects with late-life depression, half  of whom had high levels of comorbid anxiety. Subjects were trained on the Preparing  to Overcome Prepotency (POP) task, which is an executive control task that reliably  activates the lateral prefrontal cortex-anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) cognitive  control circuit. RESULTS: Time series analysis showed that, when compared with  elderly depressed subjects, elderly subjects with anxious depression performing the  POP task produced a significantly greater and more sustained signal in three  regions: BA24 (dorsal anterior cingulate), BA31 (posterior cingulate), and BA6  (prefrontal cortex). While elderly subjects with pure depression presented a bimodal  activation curve in the dorsal anterior cingulate and the posterior cingulate,  elderly subjects with anxious depression presented a sustained unimodal activation  pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results suggest specific activation patterns  unique to anxious depression that may suggest greater and more sustained efforts of  the ACC to carry out cognitive control tasks. Further research is needed to clarify  the neuroanatomical basis of LLAD.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Existing treatments for depression are known to have only modest effects, are insufficiently targeted, and are inconsistently utilized, particularly  in older adults. Indeed, older adults with impaired cognitive control networks tend  to demonstrate poor response to a majority of existing depression interventions.  Cognitive control interventions delivered using entertainment software have the  potential to not only target the underlying cerebral dysfunction associated with  depression, but to do so in a manner that is engaging and engenders adherence to  treatment protocol. METHODS: In this proof-of-concept trial (Clinicaltrials.gov \#:  NCT02229188), individuals with late life depression (LLD) (22; 60+ years old) were  randomized to either problem solving therapy (PST, n = 10) or a neurobiologically  inspired digital platform designed to enhance cognitive control faculties (Project:  EVO™, n = 12). Given the overlapping functional neuroanatomy of mood disturbances  and executive dysfunction, we explored the impact of an intervention targeting  cognitive control abilities, functional disability, and mood in older adults  suffering from LLD, and how those outcomes compare to a therapeutic gold standard.  RESULTS: EVO participants demonstrated similar improvements in mood and  self-reported function after 4 weeks of treatment to PST participants. The EVO  participants also showed generalization to untrained measures of working memory and  attention, as well as negativity bias, a finding not evident in the PST condition.  Individuals assigned to EVO demonstrated 100\% adherence. CONCLUSIONS: This study  provides preliminary findings that this therapeutic video game targeting cognitive  control deficits may be an efficacious LLD intervention. Future research is needed  to confirm these findings.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether problem-solving therapy is an effective treatment in older patients with depression and executive  dysfunction, a population likely to be resistant to antidepressant drugs. METHOD:  Participants were adults age 60 and older with major depression and executive  dysfunction. Problem-solving therapy was modified to be accessible to this  population. Participants were randomly assigned to 12 weekly sessions of  problem-solving therapy or supportive therapy and assessed at weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12.  RESULTS: Of the 653 individuals referred for this study, 221 met selection criteria  and were enrolled in the study. Reduction of depressive symptom severity was  comparable for the two treatment groups during the first 6 weeks of treatment, but  at weeks 9 and 12 the problem-solving therapy group had a greater reduction in  symptom severity, a greater response rate, and a greater remission rate than the  supportive therapy group (response rates at week 9: 47.1\% and 29.3\%; at week  12:56.7\% and 34.0\%; remission rates at week 9: 37.9\% and 21.7\%; at week 12: 45.6\%  and 27.8\%). Problem-solving therapy yielded one additional response or remission  over supportive therapy for every 4.4-5.6 patients by the end of the trial.  CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that problem-solving therapy is effective in  reducing depressive symptoms and leading to treatment response and remission in a  considerable number of older patients with major depression and executive  dysfunction. The clinical value of this finding is that problem-solving therapy may  be a treatment alternative in an older patient population likely to be resistant to  pharmacotherapy.},

Avant tout outil d’aide à la gestion des données d’un projet de recherche et à la définition de bonnes pratiques, il s’agit également d’un livrable à usage externe, dont la rédaction est exigée par de nombreux financeurs de la recherche. L’ANR (depuis 2019) et la Commission européenne (depuis 2014), entre autres, exigent des chercheurs qui soumettent une demande de financement qu’ils fournissent un plan de gestion détaillé des données de recherche qu’ils comptent utiliser. Ce document témoigne de la bonne gestion des données au cours du projet et il permet de déterminer quelles données de recherche pourront être mises à la disposition du plus grand nombre, dans un souci de transparence scientifique et de partage des savoirs. Mais à quoi ressemble exactement un PGD ? Quelles sont les informations indispensables à y inscrire ? Existe-t-il des modèles ? Comment inscrire ce travail chronophage dans un projet de recherche et le valoriser ? Est-ce vraiment bien utile ? \#\#\# Objectifs Cette formation vise à présenter en détails le concept de « plan de gestion des données » et à expliciter en quoi ce document, qui peut apparaître à première vue comme un fardeau administratif supplémentaire, peut en réalité apporter de nouvelles pistes de réflexion dans la recherche. L’objectif de cette journée est de permettant aux producteurs de données de s’interroger sur les bonnes pratiques à adopter à toutes les étapes de leur projet, qu’il s’agisse d’un projet financé ou d’une thèse de doctorat. La formation sera également l’occasion de découvrir les nombreuses ressources et outils qui sont à la disposition des doctorants et des chercheurs pour faciliter leur rédaction, ainsi que les options qui s’offrent à eux pour valoriser ce travail.~ À l’issue de la formation, le stagiaire sera capable de : 1.~~ ~Donner une définition de ce qu’est un plan de gestion des données 2.~~ ~Citer les questions auxquelles doit répondre un PGD 3.~~ ~Discerner les cas dans lesquels la rédaction d’un PGD est obligatoire de ceux dans lesquels il n’est qu’utile 4.~~ ~Comprendre en quoi la rédaction d’un PGD participe du mouvement de la science ouverte (open science) 5.~~ ~Utiliser l’outil DMP-OPIDoR pour rédiger un plan de gestion des données 6.~~ ~Connaître les critères selon lesquels la Commission européenne évalue un PGD, et auto-évaluer son propre PGD 7.~~ ~Donner une définition de ce que sont un data paper et un data journal, et savoir où trouver de telles ressources \#\# PROGRAMME 1.~~ ~Quelques rappels sur les données de la recherche 2.~~ ~Le PGD en théorie : définition et modèles 3.~~ ~Le PGD en pratique : guide de rédaction et étude de plans rédigés 4.~~ ~Le PGD en pratique : un retour d’expérience de rédaction 5.~~ ~Boîte à outils : prise en main de DMP OPIDoR 6.~~ ~Valoriser son PGD : introduction aux data papers \#\# PRÉ-REQUIS Savoir utiliser un navigateur web.

  abstract = {The effect of artificial food colors (AFCs) on child behavior has been studied for more than 35~years, with accumulating evidence from imperfect studies. This article summarizes the history of this controversial topic and testimony to the 2011 Food and Drug Administration Food Advisory Committee convened to evaluate the current status of evidence regarding attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Features of ADHD relevant to understanding the AFC literature are explained: ADHD is a quantitative diagnosis, like hypertension, and some individuals near the threshold may be pushed over it by a small symptom increment. The chronicity and pervasiveness make caregiver ratings the most valid measure, albeit subjective. Flaws in many studies include nonstandardized diagnosis, questionable sample selection, imperfect blinding, and nonstandardized outcome measures. Recent data suggest a small but significant deleterious effect of AFCs on children's behavior that is not confined to those with diagnosable ADHD. AFCs appear to be more of a public health problem than an ADHD problem. AFCs are not a major cause of ADHD per se, but seem to affect children regardless of whether or not they have ADHD, and they may have an aggregated effect on classroom climate if most children in the class suffer a small behavioral decrement with additive or synergistic effects. Possible biological mechanisms with published evidence include the effects on nutrient levels, genetic vulnerability, and changes in electroencephalographic beta-band power. A table clarifying the Food and Drug Administration and international naming systems for AFCs, with cross-referencing, is provided.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The current investigation utilized mid-life and late-life participants diagnosed with hoarding disorder (HD) to explore the relationship between executive  functioning and hoarding severity. DESIGN: Correlational analyses were used to  investigate the associations between executive functioning and hoarding severity in  nondemented participants. Multiple regression was used to determine if executive  functioning had a unique association with HD severity when accounting for depressive  symptoms. SETTING: Participants were recruited from the San Diego area for HD  intervention studies. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 113 nondemented adults aged  50-86 years who met DSM-5 criteria for HD. The mean age of the sample utilized in  the analyses was 63.76 years (SD, 7.2; range, 51-85 years). The sample was mostly  female (72\%), Caucasian (81.4\%), and unmarried (78\%). MEASUREMENTS: Hoarding  severity was assessed using the Saving Inventory-Revised and the Clutter Image  Rating and depression was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.  Executive functioning was assessed using the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST-128)  and the Trail Making and Verbal Fluency subtests of the Delis-Kaplan Executive  Function System. RESULTS: Executive function (operationalized as perseveration on  the WCST-128) was significantly associated with Clutter Image Ratings. In a  multivariate context, executive function and depressive symptom severity were both  significant predictors of variance in Clutter Image Rating. CONCLUSIONS: Our results  suggest that executive function is related to severity of HD symptoms and should be  considered as part of the conceptualization of HD.},

  abstract = {Autism has been increasing dramatically since its description by Leo Kanner in 1943. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2018 has identified 1 in 59 children (1 in 37 boys and 1 in 151 girls) has autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Autistic spectrum disorders and ADHD are complex conditions in which nutritional and environmental factors play major roles. It is important to understand how food can have an impact on their current and future health. Appealing food colors stimulate the consumption of different food products. Since 2011, it is evident that dyes are linked to harmful effects in children. Artificial dyes have neurotoxic chemicals that aggravate mental health problems. Many families with autistic children avoid food dyes in their diet in order to avoid behavioral issues. A study reported that there is a correlation between yellow dye and sleep disturbance. Food colors Blue 1 and 2, Green 3, Red 3, Yellow 5 and 6, Citrus Red 2, and Red 40 can trigger many behaviors in most kids. Artificial food color usually contains petroleum and is manufactured in a chemical process that includes formaldehyde, aniline, hydroxides, and sulfuric acids. Most impurities in the food color are in the form of salts or acids. Sometimes lead, arsenic, and mercury may be present as impurities. The U.S. FDA is yet to study the effects of synthetic dyes on behavior in children. A study conducted at Southampton University in England found a link between food dyes and hyperactive behavior in children. The research does not prove that food coloring actually causes autism spectrum disorder, but there seems to be a link. This chapter attempts to provide a broad review of the available literature on food color and the epidemiology, etiology, prevention, and treatment of autistic spectrum disorder.},

  abstract = {Alterations in neural systems underlying cognitive control are well-documented across individuals with various internalizing disorders. The current study examined  how individual differences in underlying traits related to internalizing disorders  influence brain activation, as assessed by fMRI, when cognitive control must be  exerted to make a decision about the emotional valence (positive, negative) of a  task-relevant word displayed concurrently with a task-irrelevant emotional face.  Taking a bi-factor model approach, fifty-five middle-aged female participants were  characterized on symptom level on a common internalizing latent factor representing  shared symptoms across anxiety and depression, as well as on specific factors  remaining after taking the common internalizing factor into account: low positive  affect, anxious arousal, and anxious apprehension. Contrasting activation on trials  requiring higher vs. lower control revealed that higher levels of the Common  Internalizing factor are associated with less deactivation of regions of the default  mode network. Higher levels of the Low Positive Affect-specific factor are  associated with less differentiation in engagement of portions of the  fronto-parietal control network, while higher levels of the Anxious Arousal-specific  factor are associated with less of a differentiation in activation of the thalamus.  No effects were observed for level of the Anxious Apprehension-specific factor.  These results suggest that prior findings of alterations in default mode activity  associated with depression may not be specific to depressive symptoms per se but may  characterize internalizing symptoms more generally. In addition, they suggest that  reduced engagement of cognitive control regions may be more associated with low  positive affect than depressive symptoms more generally.},

The most common AFCs were Red 40 (29.8\% of products), Blue 1 (24.2\%), Yellow 5 (20.5\%), and Yellow 6 (19.5\%). Produce was the only category that did not have any AFCs. The highest percentage of products with AFCs was found in candies (96.3\%), fruit-flavored snacks (94\%), and drink mixes/powders (89.7\%). Forty-one of the 66 companies marketed products containing AFCs. Given concerns about health effects of AFCs and high proportions of high-AFC categories, clinicians, parents, food companies, and the government can take steps to support children's healthy eating and development by reducing AFCs in children's diets.},

  abstract = {We analyze a family of extensive-form solution procedures for games with incomplete information that do not require the specification of an epistemic type space a la Harsanyi, but can accommodate a (commonly known) collection of explicit restrictions D on first-order beliefs. For any fixed D we obtain a solution called D-rationalizability.In static games, D-rationalizability characterizes the set of outcomes (combinations of payoff types and strategies) that may occur in any Bayesian equilibrium model consistent with D; these are precisely the outcomes consistent with common certainty of rationality and of the restrictions D. Hence, our approach to the analysis of incomplete-information games is consistent with Harsanyi's, and it may be viewed as capturing the robust implications of Bayesian equilibrium analysis.In dynamic games, D-rationalizability yields a forward-induction refinement of this set of Bayesian equilibrium outcomes. Focusing on the restriction that first-order beliefs be consistent with a given distribution on terminal nodes, we obtain a refinement of self-confirming equilibrium. In signalling games, this refinement coincides with the Iterated Intuitive Criterion.},

To cultivate critical thinkers, librarians continue to build innovative practices, even as technology rapidly evolves. However, the pervasiveness of misinformation and disinformation, most recently seen in the conspiratorial worldviews of QAnon, challenges librarians to center critical thinking in their information literacy praxis. In this article, we provide a concise overview of QAnon and the problems that contemporary internet conspiracy theories like it pose. We offer an epistemological shift for information literacy, from heuristics to mindsets and behaviors, drawing on disciplines external to librarianship. Finally, we consider the role that emotions play in the promotion and spread of conspiracism. Equipping librarians with a better understanding of conspiracy thinking and the tools to counter it will in turn empower the next generation of critical thinkers.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate citalopram for executive functioning in Huntington's disease (HD). METHODS: The study was randomized,  double-blind, and placebo-controlled. Thirty-three adults with HD, cognitive  complaints, and no depression (Hamilton Depression [HAM-D] rating scale ≤ 12) were  administered citalopram 20 mg or placebo (7 visits, 20 weeks), with practice and  placebo run-ins. The primary outcome was change in executive functioning. RESULTS:  The intent to treat analysis was controlled for practice effects, comparing visits 1  and 2 to visits 5 and 6 for citalopram versus placebo. There were no significant  benefits on the executive function composite (treatment-placebo mean difference  -0.167; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -0.361 to 0.028; P =\,.092). Citalopram  participants showed improved clinician-rated depression symptoms on the HAM-D (t  =\,-2.02; P = 0.05). There were no group differences on motor ratings, self-reported  executive functions, psychiatric symptoms, or functional status. CONCLUSIONS: There  was no evidence that short-term treatment with citalopram improved executive  functions in HD. Despite excluding patients with active depression, participants on  citalopram showed improved mood, raising the possibility of efficacy for  subsyndromal depression in HD.},

Dans la profusion de textes écrits après novembre 2016, tous s’accordent sur l'idée que les fake news sont un «~mal du siècle~» contre lequel les bibliothécaires ont vocation à s'engager. Sur ce point, si la question des moyens se pose, ce n’est pas le cas de la légitimité en tant que bibliothécaire à intervenir dans ce champ. Comment, en effet, ne pas voir des deux côtés de l’Atlantique la question des fake news comme un prolongement de celle de «~l’évaluation de l’information~» qui apparaît depuis les années~90 dans le corpus des enseignements délivrés par les formateurs en bibliothèque. Le sésame «~fake news~» permet donc de donner un nouveau lustre à ces apprentissages, même si l'objet a un peu changé au passage. À l'origine, en effet, les efforts se focalisaient sur la notion d’autorité et la spécificité du texte scientifique –~ou comment permettre aux étudiants de mieux le distinguer d'une information vulgarisée.

  abstract = {Despite the scientific consensus about the anthropogenic nature of climate change, there are still obstacles hindering society from acknowledging the severity of the situation. Notably, previous research suggests that climate change threats can cause people to display ethnocentric reaction to preserve the ingroup’s interests. In this research, we investigate the relation between collective narcissism and attitudes towards climate science. We argue that national collective narcissism is negatively associated with the acceptance of climate science. We further hypothesized that this relation might be mediated by conspiracy beliefs about climate change, because narcissistic identifiers are prone to hold conspiracy beliefs. In a pilot Study (N = 409), we found that national collective narcissism was significantly associated with climate change conspiracy beliefs. In Study 1 (N = 295), climate change conspiracy beliefs mediated the negative relation between national collective narcissism and acceptance of climate science. In Study 2 (N = 375), this mediation was replicated when controlling for other forms of climate skepticism. Lastly, general conspiracy mentality did not mediate this relation, which emphasizes the importance of considering the specificity of climate change conspiracy theories (rather than generic propensity to believe in conspiracy theories) in understanding distrust toward climate science.},

This study examined if either patient perception of ED or the Trail Making Test Part  B (TMT-B) could identify patients with impairment on the SCWT or DRS IP. METHODS:  Patients were 65 or older and had a diagnosis of major depression without dementia.  Cognition was assessed with the TMT-B, the SCWT, and the DRS IP. A self-reported  Perceived Deficits Questionnaire (PDQ) subscale assessed patients' perceptions of  ED. RESULTS: In 247 participants (mean age 71.3 years), the PDQ subscale was not  associated with test performance. The sensitivity of the TMT-B in identifying  impairment on the SCWT or DRS IP was low (35\% and 23\%, respectively). CONCLUSION:  Neither the TMT-B nor self-reports are useful screening tools for ED on the SCWT or  DRS IP.},

METHODS: The authors analyzed data from 142 persons aged 60 years  or older with major depression with psychotic features who participated in a 12-week  randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing olanzapine plus sertraline with  olanzapine plus placebo. The independent variables were baseline cerebrovascular  risk (Framingham Stroke Risk Score), baseline executive function (Stroop  interference score and the initiation/perseveration subscale of the Mattis Dementia  Rating Scale), and baseline processing speed (color and word reading components of  the Stroop). The outcome variable was change in severity of depression, measured by  the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale total score, during the course of the  RCT. RESULTS: Greater baseline cerebrovascular risk was significantly associated  with less improvement in depression severity over time, after controlling for  pertinent covariates. Neither executive function nor processing speed predicted  outcome. CONCLUSION: This study suggests an association of cerebrovascular risk, but  not executive function or processing speed, with treatment outcome of major  depression with psychotic features in older adults.},

Les réseaux sociaux sont un théâtre d’ombres où le débat est souvent remplacé par l’invective : chacun, craignant d’y rencontrer un contradicteur, préfère traquer cent ennemis. Au-delà même de Twitter ou de Facebook, le champ intellectuel et politique se confond avec un champ de bataille où tous les coups sont permis. Partout de féroces prêcheurs préfèrent attiser les haines plutôt qu’éclairer les esprits.Avec ce livre, Jean Birnbaum veut apporter du réconfort à toutes les femmes, tous les hommes qui refusent la «brutalisation» de notre débat public et qui veulent préserver l’espace d’une discussion aussi franche qu’argumentée. Pour cela, il relit les textes de quelques intellectuels et écrivains qui ne se sont jamais contentés d’opposer l’idéologie à l’idéologie, les slogans aux slogans. Renouer avec Albert Camus, George Orwell, Hannah Arendt, Raymond Aron, Georges Bernanos, Germaine Tillion ou encore Roland Barthes, ce n’est pas seulement trouver refuge auprès de figures aimées, qui permettent de tenir bon, de se tenir bien.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: No prior study has investigated whether impairment of specific cognitive functions at baseline may predict the short-term treatment outcome of  electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in elderly non-demented patients with major  depression (MD). METHODS: This longitudinal cohort study included 65 elderly  patients with unipolar or bipolar MD, aged 60-85 years, treated with formula-based  ECT. Treatment outcome was assessed using the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for  Depression (HRSD17). Cognitive function at baseline was assessed using nine  neuropsychological tests or subtests measuring information processing speed, verbal  learning and memory, and aspects of executive function. RESULTS: A poorer  performance on the word reading task of the Color Word Interference Test rendered  higher odds of achieving remission during the ECT course (p=0.021). Remission was  defined as an HRSD17 score of 7 or less. There were no other significant  associations between the treatment outcome of ECT and cognitive performance  parameters assessed at baseline. LIMITATIONS: The limited number of subjects may  have reduced the generalizability of the findings. Multiple statistical tests  increase the risk for making a type I error. CONCLUSIONS: How well patients perform  on neuropsychological tests at baseline is most likely not a predictor of, or  otherwise not significantly associated with the treatment outcome of formula-based  ECT in elderly patients with MD.},

The stop signal task (SST) was designed by Rubia et al. for use  with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify the neural correlates  of motor response inhibition, a well-characterized executive function. In this  study, we compared brain activation between a group of unmedicated participants with  LLD and an unmedicated healthy cohort during SST performance. METHODS: Participants  55-85 years of age were screened, clinically evaluated, and entered into either the  LLD (n = 15) or healthy comparison group (n = 13). Both groups underwent  neuroimaging while performing the SST under similar conditions. The brain circuitry  of successful motor inhibition was evaluated by contrasting the condition of  correctly inhibiting responses with the condition of correctly responding to Go  signals. Differential areas of brain activation between the LLD and comparison  groups were determined with FMRIB Software Library. RESULTS: Despite comparable SST  performance measures, LLD participants demonstrated greater blood oxygen level  dependent activation relative to the comparison group in predominantly  left-lateralized frontostriatal-limbic circuitry that included the bilateral  superior frontal cortices and left-hemispheric orbitofrontal gyri, insular cortex,  cingulate cortex, caudate, and putamen. Conversely, the healthy comparison group did  not exhibit any areas of greater activation than the LLD group. CONCLUSION:  Unmedicated participants with LLD activate additional areas within  frontostriatal-limbic brain circuitry when performing the SST at a level comparable  to a healthy cohort.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is the most effective treatment for drug-resistant depression (DRD). We estimated the short- and long-term effects of  ECT on cognitive functions in patients with unipolar and bipolar DRD. METHODS: We  investigated 63 patients (18 male, 45 female), aged 34-75 years. Cognitive  assessments were performed before, immediately after 6-12 ECT sessions, and 3 months  thereafter, using the Benton Visual Retention, Trail Making (TMT), Rey-Osterrieth  Complex Figure (ROCF) tests, the Digit Span of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence  Scale, and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning (RAVLT), verbal fluency and Stroop  tests. RESULTS: Immediately after ECT, a significant worsening was noted in some  indices of memory and verbal fluency. However, 3 months after ECT, the indices of  both RAVLT and verbal fluency significantly improved compared to baseline, and those  of the Benton and ROCF were significantly better than before ECT. The Digit Span,  Stroop and TMT were not affected by the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The negative effects  of ECT on the reported measures of cognition are transient. After 3 months, the  indices of memory were significantly better than before the treatment. In addition  to its antidepressant effect in DRD, ECT may also exert a long-term favourable  influence on some cognitive functions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cognitive and emotional sequellae are commonly observed in stroke patients and these symptoms often co-occur. Diagnosis can be difficult since  symptoms of depression and executive dysfunction overlap. OBJECTIVE: To study the  longitudinal relationship between depressive symptoms and executive dysfunction in  stroke patients. METHODS: The study comprises of 116 first-ever stroke patients who  were followed-up for 2 years and who were assessed for emotional and cognitive  sequellae after 1, 6, 12, and 24 months. Emotional disturbances were evaluated using  the SCL-90 depression subscale. Executive functions were assessed using compound  scores of a combination of the interference scores of the Stroop Colour Word Test  and the Concept Shifting Test. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients suffered from both  depressive symptoms and executive dysfunction, 28 patients were depressed with no  signs of executive dysfunction, and 13 patients showed executive dysfunction with no  depressive symptoms. Patients with executive dysfunction had higher mean SCL-90-D  scores compared to patients with no executive dysfunction (30.9 (SD 11.7) versus  26.2 (SD 11.1, p = 0.037). Depressive symptoms were predictive for executive  dysfunction in a regression analysis corrected for age, sex, and diabetes mellitus  but not after additional correction for pre-existent brain damage and other vascular  risk factors. After 2 years 66.6 and 53.3\% of patients with both depressive symptoms  and executive dysfunction at baseline still had depressive symptoms and executive  dysfunctions respectively and had worse prognostic outcome than patients with  depressive symptoms or executive dysfunction alone. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms of  depression and executive dysfunction are highly prevalent in stroke patients and  often co-occur. These patients are more at risk for poor stroke outcome, chronic  depression, and cognitive deterioration.},

White privilege, male privilege, straight privilege―those conditions make everyday life easier, less stressful, more lucrative, and generally better for those who hold one, two, or all three designations. But what about white female privilege in the context of feminism? Or fixed gender privilege in the context of transgender? Or weight and height privilege in the context of hiring practices and salary levels? Or food privilege in the context of widening inequality for single-parent families?In The Perils of “Privilege,” Phoebe Maltz Bovy examines the rise of this word into extraordinary potency. Does calling out privilege help to change or soften it? Or simply reinforce it by dividing people against themselves? And is privilege a concept that, in fact, only privileged people are debating? The Perils of “Privilege” explores how this word is deployed, and offers ways to begin anew so many of the conversations it has silenced.},

At three such enriched habitats in Monterey Bay, CA, at a depth of nearly 3000 m, we observed pycnogonids (sea spiders) of at least two species, Colossendeis gigas and C. japonica, feeding on sea anemones that were commonly found there. Submersible remotely operated vehicles provided direct observations of feeding, as well as high definition video and photographic images. We recorded the co-occurrence of both pycnogonids and prey anemones during ten of 12 visits during 2002–2006. Anemones and pycnogonids were conspicuously more abundant at these oases than in the surrounding benthos. The sedentary anemone Anthosactis pearseae was attached directly to whalebones while the pom-pom anemone, Liponema brevicornis, was found resting on soft sediment, rolling in benthic currents, or accumulating where these currents were disrupted by topography, as at whale falls, wood falls, and clam fields. Both pycnogonid species were observed feeding on these anemones, either as predators or as micropredators.},

Multiple genes have been reported to be linked to monogenic PD but these only explain a fraction of the observed familial aggregation. Rare variants in RIC3 have been suggested to be associated with PD in the Indian population. However, replication studies yielded inconsistent results. We further investigate the role of RIC3 variants in PD in European cohorts using individual-level genotyping data from 14,671 PD patients and 17,667 controls, as well as whole-genome sequencing data from 1,615 patients and 961 controls. We also investigated RIC3 using summary statistics from a Latin American cohort of 1,481 individuals, and from a cohort of 31,575 individuals of East Asian ancestry. We did not identify any association between RIC3 and PD in any of the cohorts. However, more studies of rare variants in non-European ancestry populations, in particular South Asian populations, are necessary to further evaluate the world-wide role of RIC3 in PD etiology.},

METHODS: The study uses  baseline data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center. Data were collected  across Alzheimer's Disease Centers in the USA. The sample included 12,634  individuals (cognitive intact\,=\,8022; amnestic mild cognitive impairment  [aMCI]\,=\,3652; nonamnestic MCI [nonaMCI]\,=\,960). The Geriatric Depression Scale  assessed depression; the Trail Making Test assessed executive function. RESULTS: The  proportion of participants with depression was higher in the aMCI (18\%) and nonaMCI  group (21\%) as compared with that in the cognitively intact group (8\%); there was no  difference in rates of depression between aMCI and nonaMCI groups. The proportion of  participants with executive dysfunction differed between nondepressed and depressed  individuals for the cognitively intact (8\% vs. 12\%) and aMCI groups (28\% vs. 35\%),  but not for the nonaMCI group (37\% vs. 41\%). Nine percent of the cognitively intact  group had executive dysfunction compared with 31\% of the aMCI group and 40\% of the  nonaMCI group. The proportion of participants with hypertension was greater in  individuals with executive dysfunction compared with those with no executive  deficits; the presence of hypertension was not associated with depression severity.  CONCLUSIONS: The confluence of vascular risk factors, episodic memory impairment,  and depression and executive dysfunction highlights the need for comprehensive  assessment of depressed older adults that can aid clinicians in the formulation of  treatment planning and inform clinicians and researchers about long-term prognosis.},

DESIGN: The study uses baseline data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating  Center. SETTING: Data were collected at multiple Alzheimer's Disease Centers in the  United States. PARTICIPANTS: The sample included a total of 3,117 individuals with  MCI, mean age = 74.37 years, SD: 9.37 (aMCI, n = 2,488; non-aMCI, n = 629).  MEASUREMENTS: The 10-item Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire assessed  function. RESULTS: Depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale), memory  impairment (Logical Memory II), and processing speed decrements (Digit Symbol  Substitution Test) were significantly associated with functional impairment (p  {$<$}0.001). Processing speed partially mediated the effect of depression on function  and fully mediated the effect of executive dysfunction on function (p {$<$}0.001) in the  total MCI and aMCI subsample, while in the non-aMCI subsample, processing speed  mediated the effect of executive function but not the effect of depression (p =  0.20) on function. CONCLUSIONS: The findings show that processing speed is central  to the effect that depression and executive dysfunction have on functional  impairment in cognitively impaired older adults. Future studies are needed to better  understand the physiologic underpinnings in age-related and disease-specific  decrements in processing speed, and to address the problems in the assessment of  processing speed in clinical samples.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Based on findings that major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated to decreased dorsolateral prefrontal cortical (DLPFC) activity; interventions that  increase DLPFC activity might theoretically present antidepressant effects. Two of  them are cognitive control therapy (CCT), a neurocognitive intervention that uses  computer-based working memory exercises, and transcranial direct current stimulation  (tDCS), which delivers weak, electric direct currents over the scalp. METHODS: We  investigated whether tDCS enhanced the effects of CCT in a double-blind trial, in  which participants were randomized to sham tDCS and CCT (n=17) vs. active tDCS and  CCT (n=20). CCT and tDCS were applied for 10 consecutive workdays.  Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01434836. RESULTS: Both CCT alone and combined  with tDCS ameliorated depressive symptoms after the acute treatment period and at  follow-up, with a response rate of approximately 25\%. Older patients and those who  presented better performance in the task throughout the trial (possibly indicating  greater engagement and activation of the DLPFC) had greater depression improvement  in the combined treatment group. LIMITATIONS: Our exploratory findings should be  further confirmed in prospective controlled trials. DISCUSSION: CCT and tDCS  combined might be beneficial for older depressed patients, particularly for those  who have cognitive resources to adequately learn and improve task performance over  time. This combined therapy might be specifically relevant in this subgroup that is  more prone to present cognitive decline and prefrontal cortical atrophy.},

  abstract = {Key points{$<$}list id="tjp6378-list-0001" list-type="bulleted"{$>$} Hyperactivity of the stress system and low-grade immune activation characterize the functional bowel disorder irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). These studies show that interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 and the stress hormone corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), present in IBS plasma, have functional effects on gastrointestinal activity by stimulating myenteric neurons and colonic contractions. Moreover, in the Wistar Kyoto rat model of IBS, which exhibits altered gastrointestinal motility and visceral pain sensitivity, blocking IL-6 and/or CRF1 receptors alleviates these IBS-like symptoms. Underlying these effects are altered colonic protein expression of tight junction proteins which regulate gut barrier function and the T-type calcium channel Ca(V)3.2, which has been linked to visceral pain. These findings demonstrate the importance of the enteric nervous system and intestinal physiology in bowel dysfunction. AbstractThe search for effective therapeutic strategies for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is hampered by an incomplete understanding of its underlying pathophysiology. Stress and altered plasma cytokine profiles indicative of immune activation are characteristic of the disorder. The neuromodulatory effects of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and corticotropin-releasing factor receptor (CRFR) 1 in visceral pain and stress-induced defecation in the Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rat model of IBS were investigated. Sprague Dawley and WKY rats were administered anti-IL-6 receptor antibodies (xIL-6R, 0.5mgkg(-1) i.p) with or without the CRFR1 antagonist antalarmin (10mgkg(-1) i.p). Post-intervention, the pain threshold to colorectal distension and stress-induced faecal output were compared and changes in colonic mucosal protein expression were investigated. The neuro-stimulatory effects of IBS plasma on the myenteric plexus is mediated by IL-6, IL-8 and CRF. The stimulatory effects of these soluble factors on myenteric neuron excitability and colonic contractility were additive. Moreover, inhibition of IL-6 and CRF1 receptors in vivo in the WKY IBS rat model normalized stress-induced defecation (P{$<$}0.01) and visceral pain sensitivity (P{$<$}0.001) with associated changes in protein expression of the tight junction proteins occludin and claudin 2, the visceral pain-associated T-type calcium channel Ca(V)3.2 and intracellular signalling molecules STAT3, SOCS3 and ERK1/2. These studies demonstrate the additive effects of immune and stress factors on myenteric neuronal excitability. Moreover, combined targeting of peripheral IL-6 and CRF1 receptors is effective in alleviating IBS-like symptoms in the WKY rat.

  abstract = {In recent decades, changing lifestyles in Canadian homes has led to demand for foods with long shelf lives that are cosmetically appealing, palatable, easy to prepare and to consume. Food additives, especially preservatives and artificial colours as well as suboptimal intake of essential nutrients, have been linked to hyperactive behaviours and poor attention in a subgroup of children. Although other risk factors (ie, genetic, etc) for these conditions have received more attention in the scientific literature, the authors believe that there is enough evidence to consider dietary influences as a modifiable risk factor. This would involve raising awareness among clinicians and, subsequently, reviewing food regulatory processes to better protect children in Canada - similar to the regulations recently undertaken by the British Food Standards Agency. Conflicts of interest due to food and medication industry support for organizations advocating for children would need to be resolved by open communication between government regulatory agencies, academia and industry. Canadian parents and children need to be advised to limit unnecessary food additives and consume a diet rich in essential nutrients while more complete relationships are being explored further.},

Il suffirait d'écouter les experts pour devenir heureux. L'industrie du bonheur, qui brasse des millions d'euros, affirme ainsi pouvoir façonner les individus en créatures capables de faire obstruction aux sentiments négatifs, de tirer le meilleur parti d'elles-mêmes en contrôlant totalement leurs désirs improductifs et leurs pensées défaitistes. Mais n'aurions-nous pas affaire ici à une autre ruse destinée à nous convaincre, encore une fois, que la richesse et la pauvreté, le succès et l'échec, la santé et la maladie sont de notre seule responsabilité ? Et si la dite science du bonheur visait à nous convertir à un modèle individualiste niant toute idée de société ? Edgar Cabanas et Eva Illouz reconstituent ici avec brio les origines de cette nouvelle " science " et explorent les implications d'un phénomène parmi les plus captivants et inquiétants de ce début de siècle (4e de couverture)},

La confiance peut être regagnée en traitant le problème à la racine : la propriété des médias. Comment les citoyens peuvent-ils accorder leur confiance aux médias si aucune règle claire n’empêche un actionnaire d’interférer dans le fonctionnement des rédactions ou de faire licencier un journaliste qui lui déplaît ? Doit-on se satisfaire d'une situation dans laquelle une poignée d'industriels possèdent la quasi-totalité des médias, limitant le pluralisme d’opinions et appauvrissant d’autant le débat public ? Est-il acceptable que les journalistes ne soient pas consultés lorsque leur titre est vendu à tel ou tel « mécène » ? Il n’existe pas de fatalité à ce que les médias se vident de leurs journalistes au fil de leurs rachats successifs par des industriels. L’information est un bien public dont la production doit être confiée à des journalistes disposant d’une véritable indépendance éditoriale, et nous pensons que cette indépendance est possible en adoptant de nouvelles règles. Ce livre vise à armer les citoyens, les journalistes et les régulateurs en faisant toute la lumière sur les différentes formes de propriété des médias et les limites des régulations existantes. Il ne s’agit pas de questions techniques, mais des fondamentaux d’un débat démocratique éclairé. Pour cela, nous proposons une loi de démocratisation de l'information permettant aux journalistes et aux citoyens de reprendre enfin le contrôle des médias. Des médias indépendants gouvernés de manière démocratique et tournés vers la production d’une information de qualité. Rejoignez-nous dans ce combat ! (éditeur)},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Depression is frequently characterized by patterns of inflexible, maladaptive, and ruminative thinking styles, which are thought to result from a  combination of decreased attentional control, decreased executive functioning, and  increased negative affect. Cognitive Control Training (CCT) uses computer-based  behavioral exercises with the aim of strengthening cognitive and emotional  functions. A previous study found that severely depressed participants who received  CCT exhibited reduced negative affect and rumination as well as improved  concentration. AIMS: The present study aimed to extend this line of research by  employing a more stringent control group and testing the efficacy of three sessions  of CCT over a 2-week period in a community population with depressed mood. METHOD:  Forty-eight participants with high Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) scores were  randomized to CCT or a comparison condition (Peripheral Vision Training; PVT).  RESULTS: Significant large effect sizes favoring CCT over PVT were found on the  BDI-II (d = 0.73, p {$<$} .05) indicating CCT was effective in reducing negative mood.  Additionally, correlations showed significant relationships between CCT performance  (indicating ability to focus attention on CCT) and state affect ratings.  CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that CCT is effective in altering depressed mood,  although it may be specific to select mood dimensions.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the psychometric properties of the Executive Interview (EXIT) and Quick EXIT in community dwelling older adults. DESIGN: Secondary analysis  of data obtained as part of a longitudinal study of cognitive function in late-life  depression. SETTING: A university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling adults  (N~= 422), aged 59 years and older, with current or recent history of non-psychotic  unipolar major depression, and never-depressed comparison subjects. MEASUREMENTS:  The EXIT and other measures of executive control functions (ECF), non-executive  cognitive domains, and global cognitive function. We calculated Quick EXIT scores  from the EXIT. RESULTS: The EXIT demonstrated high inter-rater reliability  (Intraclass correlation coefficient~= 0.978, F(7, 21)~= 174.85, p~{$<$}0.001), and both  the EXIT and Quick EXIT demonstrated moderate internal consistency (α~= 0.66 and  α~=~0.68, respectively). Both tests also demonstrated acceptable convergent validity  against several standard tests of ECF (rs~-0.399 to 0.322, except for the Trail  Making Test B, where rs was 0.057 to 0.063) as well as against measures of  multifactorial cognitive function (rs~-0.432 to 0.491). Both tests, however,  demonstrated inconsistent discriminant validity against a variety of standard  non-ECF tests (rs~-0.013 to 0.376). CONCLUSIONS: Both the EXIT and the Quick EXIT  have adequate reliability and appear to require ECF in this population. However,  both the EXIT and the Quick EXIT also reflect non-ECF domains. The EXIT and Quick  EXIT should be considered to be measures of global cognitive function rather than  pure ECF measures. Given similar reliability and validity, the Quick EXIT is  recommended clinically as it is briefer and less burdensome than the full EXIT.},

N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nACHRs) are thought to be effective in the learning and memory-generating process. In this study, we investigated the effects of intrauterine exposure to AFCAs on subunit concentrations of NMDARs and nAChRs isoforms in rats. We administered a mixture of AFCAs (Eritrosin, Ponceau 4R, Allura Red AC, Sunset Yellow FCF, Tartrazin, Amaranth, Brilliant Blue, Azoruhin and Indigotin) to female rats before and during gestation. The concentration of NR2A and NR2B subunits and nAChR alpha 7, alpha 4 beta 2 isoforms in their offspring's hippocampi were measured by Western Blotting. Expressions of NR2B and nAChR beta 2 were significantly increased (17\% and 6.70\%, respectively), whereas expression of nAChR alpha 4 was significantly decreased (5.67\%) in male experimental group compared to the male control group (p {$<$} 0.05). In the female experimental group, AFCAs caused a 14\% decrease in NR2B expression when compared to the female control group (p {$<$} 0.05). Our results indicate that exposure to AFCAs during the fetal period may lead to alterations in expressions of NMDARs and nAChRs in adulthood. These alterations were different between male and female genders. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We compared the validity of models of subcortical ischemic depression (SID) and depression-executive dysfunction syndrome (DED) in predicting functional  disability in the elderly. METHODS: We obtained data from elderly Korean subjects  (n=1356) aged 60 years or older at baseline from the CREDOS study from November 2005  to July 2014. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) model was constructed to  measure functional disability using instrumental activity of daily living as a  primary outcome. A risk factor of interest was SID and DED evaluated by a visual  rating scale of deep white matter hyperintensity in MRI, Stroop test and Geriatric  Depression Scale (GDS) score. Receiver-operating-characteristic plots and area under  the curve (AUC) test were applied to examine the difference of the two definitions  of vascular depression with predicted values of functional disability outcome.  RESULTS: The mean (SD) follow-up duration of the participants was 1.7 (0.9) years.  The GEE model showed that presence of SID at baseline predicted functional  disability compared to non-depressed subjects (GDS score: Odds ratio [OR] 1.76; 95\%  CI 1.23, 2.53; p=0.002). The association was also statistically significant among  the DED group (OR 1.48; 95\% CI 1.15, 1.92; p=0.003). There were no significant  differences in predicting functional disability (95\% CI: -0.003 to 0.009, p=0.366)  according to AUC differences between SID and DED. CONCLUSIONS: The results will be  useful in evaluating the cardinal features of the vascular depression hypothesis in  predicting functional disability.},

This study assessed the plausibility of such an association through the evaluation of mechanistic evidence collected from in vitro assays or other alternative models. Mechanisms and molecular targets underlying neurodevelopmental processes associated with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other neurodevelopmental-related symptoms (e.g., cognitive function, learning and memory disorder, etc.) were identified. Publicly available data from the ToxCast/Tox21 high-throughput screening (HTS) program and peer-reviewed literature that measure activity of the colors for such molecular targets were analyzed and reviewed. Erythrosine (Red No. 3) was active in several assays mapped to neurodevelopmental processes - specifically, HTS assays that measure signals in neurotransmitter pathways. The remaining six colors do not appear to alter signaling pathways related to neurodevelopmental processes on the molecular or cellular level. This assessment provides an approach for systematically identifying and mapping mechanistic data to putative neurodevelopmental processes as a means to prioritize substances for possible further investigation. The assessment also provides insights into the lack of activity of synthetic food colors for key events in neurodevelopmental signaling pathways.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Both remitted late-life depression (rLLD) and amnesiac mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) alter brain functions in specific regions of the brain. They are  also disconnection syndromes that are associated with a high risk of developing  Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVES: Resting-state functional connectivity magnetic  resonance imaging (rs-fcMRI) was performed to define the shared and distinct  aberrant patterns in intranetwork and internetwork connectivity between rLLD and  aMCI and to determine how knowledge of these differences might contribute to our  essential understanding of the altered sequences involved in functional systems both  inside and outside of resting-state networks. METHODS: We used rs-fcMRI to  investigate in five functionally well-defined brain networks in two large cohorts of  subjects at high risk for AD (55 rLLD and 87 aMCI) and 114 healthy controls (HC).  RESULTS: A reduced degree of functional connectivity was observed in the bilateral  inferior temporal cortex and supplemental motor area, and reduced correlations were  observed within the sensory-motor network (SMN) and in the default mode network  (DMN)-control network (CON) pair in the rLLD group than the HC group. The aMCI group  showed only focal functional changes in regions of interest pairs, a trend toward  increased correlations within the salience network and SMN, and a trend toward a  reduced correlation in the DMN-CON pair. Furthermore, the rLLD group exhibited more  severely altered functional connectivity than the aMCI group. Interestingly, these  altered connectivities were associated with specific multi-domain cognitive and  behavioral functions in both rLLD and aMCI. The degree of functional connectivity in  the right primary auditory areas was negatively correlated with Hamilton Depression  Scale scores in rLLD. Notably, altered connectivity between the right middle  temporal cortex and the posterior cerebellum was negatively correlated with Mattis  Dementia Rating Scale scores in both rLLD and aMCI. CONCLUSIONS: These results  demonstrate that rLLD and aMCI may share convergent and divergent aberrant  intranetwork and internetwork connectivity patterns as a potential continuous  spectrum of the same disease. They further suggest that dysfunctions in the right  specific temporal-cerebellum neural circuit may contribute to the similarities  observed in rLLD and aMCI conversion to AD.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Even during symptomatic remission, many patients with medication resistant depression (MRD) still demonstrate impaired cognitive function, especially  executive function (EF). Theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (TBS)  modulates cortical excitability and may treat MRD. Evidences from previous studies  show that intermittent TBS (iTBS) produces cortical excitatory effects, while  continuous TBS (cTBS) produces a reduction of cortical excitability. EF is highly  dependent on prefrontal activity, but the effects of different forms of prefrontal  TBS on EF remain unknown. METHODS: 60 MRD patients were recruited and randomly  assigned to one of four groups. Treatment was determined by the group to which an  individual was assigned; A: cTBS 1800pulses/session; B: iTBS 1800pulses/session; C:  a combination of cTBS+iTBS, 1800pulses/session for each; and D: sham TBS. Wisconsin  Card Sorting Test (WCST) for the performance of EF was evaluated before and after 10  daily treatment sessions RESULTS: Repeated measures ANOVA, with each WCST index at  baseline and 2weeks after TBS as within-subject factors, demonstrated that a  statistically significant interaction of TBS groups (G) and antidepressant responses  [(R), responses were defined as {$>$}50\% reduction of depression scores after 2-weeks  TBS treatment] on the before-versus-after changes of all WCST indexes (G×R, p{$<$}0.05).  Responders in Group B, but not in the other groups, showed a significant improvement  in WCST performance. Only nonresponders in Group A showed a trend for EF worsening.  CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that left prefrontal iTBS, not right prefrontal  cTBS, improved EF, and this can be independent from its antidepressant effects.},

Since depression is common in the elderly and strongly  associated with OI, we aimed to explore whether the comorbidity of depression and  cognitive impairment may be associated with worse outcomes. In total, 153 elderly  patients with depression and 154 normal elderly were recruited. Subjects underwent  assessments of depression, cognitive function, and OI. Information on the factors  that may affect OI performance was collected (age, sex, smoking history, diabetes,  etc.). Correlation analysis showed that several factors had a significant influence  on OI performance in the elderly, including severity of depression, cognitive  scores, age, sex, and years of education (p{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.05). Among the different cognitive  domains, OI was positively associated with global cognition, memory, language,  executive function, and attention performance (p{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.05). The multiple linear  regression analysis indicated that memory scores, age, HAMD scores, and sex were the  most relevant factors to OI scores across all elderly participants. The factorial  analysis suggested that elderly with comorbidity of depression and cognitive  impairment (memory deficits or language deficits) had worse OI impairment, and there  was an interactive effect of depression and memory deficits on OI in elderly people.  The present study suggested that the coexistence of depressive symptoms and  cognitive impairment was associated with worse OI in the elderly. Studies exploring  the association between OI and cognitive function should include an assessment of  depression and adjust the interactive effects of depression.},

  abstract = {Nowadays more and more attentions are paid to fruit quality in the production of tomato. In order to better understand the effects of deficit irrigation on tomato yield and fruit quality, four years of deficit irrigation experiments were investigated to simulate water-yield and water-fruit quality relationships of tomato in greenhouses. The yield and fruit quality parameters like total soluble solids (TSS), reducing sugars (RS), organic acids (OA), sugar/acid content ratio (SAR), vitamin C (VC), firmness (Fn), color index (CI) were correlated with seasonal evapotranspiration (ET) and ET deficit at flowering and fruit development stage (Stage II) and fruit ripening stage (Stage III) using linear regression. Three water-yield models (Jensen, Stewart, Minhas) and three water-fruit quality models (multiplicative, additive, exponential) were applied to simulate the relationships of tomato yield and fruit quality parameters with water deficit at various growth stages. The water deficit sensitivity indexes (lambda/Ky/delta or gamma/Kq/psi) of the models were calculated with the method of multiply linear regression. The performance and sensitivity analysis of the models were evaluated. Results showed that the relative yield decreased linearly with the drop of relative seasonal ET, mainly due to the yield depression by ET deficit at Stage Hand Stage III; the relative values of fruit quality parameters increased with the drop of relative seasonal ET, mostly because of the enhancement by ET deficit at Stage III. The calculated water deficit sensitivity indexes indicated that both the yield and fruit quality were hardly sensitive to water deficit at Stage I, but sensitive to water deficit at Stage II and that at Stage III; TSS, RS, SAR and VC were much more sensitive to water deficit at Stage III than that at Stage II; RS, SAR and VC were more sensitive to water deficit than TSS, OA, Fn and CI. The Minhas model with its water deficit sensitivity indexes was recommended to simulate wateryield relations of greenhouse tomato in the study area; multiplicative model and additive model were, respectively, recommended to simulate the relationships of fruit quality parameters like TSS, RS, SAR, Fn and fruit quality parameters like OA, VC, CI with water deficit at various growth stages. The water-yield and water-fruit quality models would be helpful to optimally allocate irrigation water during the growth season, thus achieving efficient production of tomato in greenhouses in consideration of the compromise between tomato yield and fruit quality.

This study examined the relationship between  neuropsychological profiles and short-term outcome in late-onset depression.  METHODS: A total of 54 non-demented Chinese elders presented with their first major  depressive episode after 60 years of age participated in this study and were treated  according to a standardised protocol. At entry, they were assessed on neurological  signs (Parkinsonian features and neurological soft signs) and neuropsychological  measures (executive function, psychomotor-speed, attention and working memory,  episodic memory, conceptualisation, construction and global cognitive function). The  Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) was administered at baseline, the sixth and  12th week of treatment. RESULTS: Abnormal fist-edge-palm (FEP) test, a sign  reflecting impairment in motor sequencing, was more common in non-remitters (defined  as HAM-D score above 7) at the 12th week of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The FEP test may  be included in the clinical assessment for patients with late-onset depression to  identify a susceptible group who may require more intensive treatment.

  abstract = {Suicidal behavior is a potentially lethal complication of late-life depression. In younger adults, suicide has been linked to abnormal decision-making ability. Given  that there are substantial age-related decreases in decision-making ability, and  that older adults experience environmental stressors that require effective  decision-making, we reasoned that impaired decision-making may be particularly  relevant to suicidal behavior in the elderly. We thus compared performance on a  probabilistic decision-making task that does not involve working memory ("Cambridge  Gamble Task") in four groups of older adults: (1) individuals with major depression  and a history of suicide attempt (n = 25), (2) individuals with major depression  with active suicidal ideation but no suicide attempt (n = 13), (3) individuals with  major depression without suicidality (n = 35), and (4) nondepressed control subjects  (n = 22). There was a significant effect of group on quality of decision-making,  whereby the suicide attempters exhibited poorer ability to choose the likely  outcome, compared with the nonsuicidal depressed and nondepressed comparison  subjects. There were no group differences in betting behavior. The suicide  attempters differed in several aspects of social problem-solving on a self-report  scale. Quality of decision-making was negatively correlated with the score on the  impulsive/careless problem-solving subscale. These data suggest that older suicide  attempters have a deficit in risk-sensitive decision-making, extending observations  in younger adults. More specifically, older suicide attempters seem to neglect  outcome probability and make poor choices. These impairments may precipitate and  perpetuate suicidal crisis in depressed elders. Identification of decision-making  impairment in suicidal elders may help with designing effective interventions.},

  abstract = {It is often argued that cost-sharing—charging a subsidized, positive price— for a health product is necessary to avoid wasting resources on those who will not use or do not need the product. We explore this argument through a field experiment in Kenya, in which we randomized the price at which prenatal clinics could sell long-lasting antimalarial insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) to pregnant women. We find no evidence that cost-sharing reduces wastage on those who will not use the product: women who received free ITNs are not less likely to use them than those who paid subsidized positive prices. We also find no evidence that costsharing induces selection of women who need the net more: those who pay higher prices appear no sicker than the average prenatal client in the area in terms of measured anemia (an important indicator of malaria). Cost-sharing does, however, considerably dampen demand. We find that uptake drops by sixty percentage points when the price of ITNs increases from zero to \$0.60 (i.e., from 100\% to 90\% subsidy), a price still \$0.15 below the price at which ITNs are currently sold to pregnant women in Kenya. We combine our estimates in a cost-effectiveness analysis of the impact of ITN prices on child mortality that incorporates both private and social returns to ITN usage. Overall, our results suggest that free distribution of ITNs could save many more lives than cost-sharing programs have achieved so far, and, given the large positive externality associated with widespread usage of ITNs, would likely do so at a lesser cost per life saved.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous study results on associations between depressive symptoms and cognitive functioning, mainly based on clinical samples and explanatory mechanisms  including potential protective factors, are yet to be clarified. To this end, we  investigated relations between depressive symptoms and executive functioning as well  as episodic memory in a representative population sample. Furthermore, we determined  the role of social support and physical activity in the explanation of cognitive  performance differences in individuals with depressive symptoms. METHODS: A total of  N\,=\,3661 participants (52\% female) from the German Health and Examination Interview  for Adults (18-79 years; M\,=\,52.71, SD\,=\,16.06) were included in the present study.  Within a larger assessment protocol, participants answered a depressive symptom  questionnaire and completed a neuropsychological test battery including executive  functioning and episodic memory. RESULTS: Depressive symptoms significantly  predicted executive functioning and episodic memory scores with small effects of  β\,=\,-0.04. Social support and physical activity mediated the relationships between  depressive symptoms and cognitive functioning. LIMITATIONS: As the present study is  cross-sectional, future research is warranted to provide more insight into causality  by following individuals with depressive symptoms over time. CONCLUSIONS: The  present findings indicate that effects from depressive symptoms on cognitive  functioning (a) have been overestimated and do not generalize to non-clinical  populations and (b) vary owing to behavioral lifestyle factors such as social  support and physical activity. Thereby, the present results highlight opportunities  for buffering cognitive decline in individuals with depressive symptoms in the  general population.},

  abstract = {Efforts to make research results open and reproducible are increasingly reflected by journal policies encouraging or mandating authors to provide data availability statements. As a consequence of this, there has been a strong uptake of data availability statements in recent literature. Nevertheless, it is still unclear what proportion of these statements actually contain well-formed links to data, for example via a URL or permanent identifier, and if there is an added value in providing such links. We consider 531, 889 journal articles published by PLOS and BMC, develop an automatic system for labelling their data availability statements according to four categories based on their content and the type of data availability they display, and finally analyze the citation advantage of different statement categories via regression. We find that, following mandated publisher policies, data availability statements become very common. In 2018 93.7\% of 21,793 PLOS articles and 88.2\% of 31,956 BMC articles had data availability statements. Data availability statements containing a link to data in a repository—rather than being available on request or included as supporting information files—are a fraction of the total. In 2017 and 2018, 20.8\% of PLOS publications and 12.2\% of BMC publications provided DAS containing a link to data in a repository. We also find an association between articles that include statements that link to data in a repository and up to 25.36\% (± 1.07\%) higher citation impact on average, using a citation prediction model. We discuss the potential implications of these results for authors (researchers) and journal publishers who make the effort of sharing their data in repositories. All our data and code are made available in order to reproduce and extend our results.},

  abstract = {Cognitive biases are systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment, and are often studied in psychology and behavioral economics. Although the reality of most of these biases is confirmed by reproducible research, there are often controversies about how to classify these biases or how to explain them. Some are effects of information-processing rules (i.e., mental shortcuts), called heuristics, that the brain uses to produce decisions or judgments. Biases have a variety of forms and appear as cognitive ("cold") bias, such as mental noise, or motivational ("hot") bias, such as when beliefs are distorted by wishful thinking. Both effects can be present at the same time.There are also controversies over some of these biases as to whether they count as useless or irrational, or whether they result in useful attitudes or behavior. For example, when getting to know others, people tend to ask leading questions which seem biased towards confirming their assumptions about the person. However, this kind of confirmation bias has also been argued to be an example of social skill: a way to establish a connection with the other person.Although this research overwhelmingly involves human subjects, some findings that demonstrate bias have been found in non-human animals as well. For example, loss aversion has been shown in monkeys and hyperbolic discounting has been observed in rats, pigeons, and monkeys.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The neuropsychological correlates of major depressive (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD), and their association with quality of life (QOL) and functioning,  have not been sufficiently studied in the literature. The present study aimed to  compare executive functions, attention, processing speed, QOL and disability between  patients with BD type I, BD type II, MDD and healthy controls. METHOD: 205  participants (n=37 BDI, 81\% female; n=35 BDII, 80\% female; n=45 MDD, 69\% female;  n=89C, 46\% female) aged between 18 and 67 years were administered an extensive  neurocognitive battery consisting of widely used standardized measures such as the  Trail Making Test, the Stroop Color-Word Test and a modified version of the  Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. Z-scores were compared between groups by ANCOVA. The  prevalence of impairments on each measure (Z-score{$<$}1.5) was compared between groups  using chi-square tests. The associations between cognition, quality of life and  functioning were evaluated through correlational analysis. RESULTS: Patients with  MDD showed poor selective and sustained attention, and exhibited impairments in  timed tasks, suggesting low efficiency of executive processing. Patients with BDI  displayed more widespread cognitive impairment than the remaining groups, and  performed worse than subjects with MDD on measures of sustained attention and  inhibitory control. Decision-making ability and attentional control were able to  distinguish between patients with BDI and BDII. QOL and disability were most  impaired in patients with BDI, and more closely associated with cognitive impairment  than in the remaining groups. LIMITATIONS: No control of pharmacological variables,  clinical or demographic characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide important  information regarding the nature and severity of the cognitive alterations  associated with different mood disorders, and may contribute to the diagnosis,  rehabilitation and treatment of these conditions.},

Cluster 1 consisted mostly of healthy adults, and had the highest functioning  and QOL. Clusters 2 contained older patients with subclinical depressive symptoms  and psychiatric comorbidities, whose impairments in QOL and functioning were  associated with mood symptoms and several cognitive abilities. Patients with MDD,  BDI or BDII with mild to moderate depression, such as those in cluster 3, may  benefit more significantly from interventions in cognitive flexibility, inhibition,  planning, and sustained attention. Lastly, patients with mood disorders and  clinically significant levels of depression, as well as a history of suicide  attempts, like those in cluster 4, may benefit from interventions aimed at working  memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility; that is, the three core  executive functions. These findings should be further investigated, and used to  guide treatments for patients with mood disorders and different patterns of  functional impairment.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine whether executive function (EF) is associated with nonremission and noncompletion of antidepressant pharmacotherapy in older adults  with depression. DESIGN: In this prospective study (July 2009 to May 2014), older  adults (aged ≥ 60 years; n = 468) with a DSM-IV-defined major depressive episode  diagnosed via structured interview received 12 weeks of venlafaxine extended release  with the goal of achieving remission. A hypothesis was made that worse baseline EF  would predict both nonremission and noncompletion (primary outcomes).  Treatment-related factors, including side effects and nonadherence, were also  studied. METHODS: Baseline EF, including response inhibition and set-shifting, was  assessed with subtests of the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System and the  semantic fluency subtest of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of  Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). Attention, immediate memory, delayed memory,  visuospatial ability, and global cognition were also assessed with the RBANS.  RESULTS: Of 468 participants, 96 (21\%) failed to complete the treatment trial, 191  (41\%) completed and remitted, and 181 (39\%) completed and did not remit. Univariate  analyses indicated that some EFs (set-shifting and semantic fluency) and other  cognitive variables (attention, immediate memory, visuospatial ability, and global  cognition) predicted treatment noncompletion, whereas no cognitive variables  predicted nonremission. In a multivariate logistic regression model, semantic  fluency (P = .003), comorbid medical burden (P {$<$} .001), and early nonadherence (P {$<$}  .001) were significant predictors of treatment noncompletion. CONCLUSIONS: Poorer EF  predicted treatment noncompletion. These findings suggest that EFs of initiation and  set maintenance (examined by the semantic fluency task) may allow depressed elderly  individuals to engage and stay in treatment. Identification of those at risk for  noncompletion may help implementation strategies for personalized care. TRIAL  REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00892047.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study examined the differences in cognitive function between middle-aged and older adults with insomnia disorder, insomnia symptoms only (ISO) or  no insomnia symptoms (NIS), in the context of other health and lifestyle factors.  METHODS: Twenty-eight thousand four hundred eighty-five participants {$>$}45 years  completed questionnaires, physical examinations, and neuropsychological testing  across domains of processing speed, memory, and executive functions. An  eight-question instrument assessed participants' sleep, defining subjects with  insomnia symptoms, probable insomnia disorder (PID), or NIS. The associations  between these three groups and cognitive performance were examined with linear  regression models adjusted for lifestyle and clinical factors. RESULTS: PID was  identified in 1,068 participants (3.7\% of the sample) while 7,813 (27.5\%)  experienced ISO. Participants with PID exhibited greater proportions of adverse  medical and lifestyle features such as anxiety, depression, and diabetes than both  other groups. Analyses adjusting for age, sex, education, as well as medical and  lifestyle factors demonstrated that adults with PID exhibited declarative memory  deficits (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test) compared with ISO or NIS. Adults with  insomnia symptoms exhibited better performance on a task of mental flexibility than  both other groups. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that insomnia disorder in  middle-aged and older adults is associated with poorer health outcomes and worse  memory performance than adults with insomnia symptoms alone or without any sleep  complaints, even after adjustment for comorbidities. The assessment of longitudinal  data within this cohort will be critical to understand if insomnia disorder may  increase the risk of further cognitive decline.},

METHODS: We  used pre-post neuropsychological data collected as part of a 12-week medication  trial comparing sertraline to nortriptyline in the treatment of older adults with  non-psychotic, unipolar major depression to examine change in cognitive functioning.  Neuropsychological assessments included mental status (Mini-Mental Status Exam),  psychomotor speed (Purdue Pegboard), attention (Continuous Performance Test, Trail  Making Test A), executive functioning (Stroop Color/word Test, Trail Making Test B),  and memory (Buschke Selective Reminding Test). RESULTS: Within treatment groups,  patients treated with sertraline improved only on verbal learning. This change did  not depend on responder status. Between treatment groups, patients treated with  sertraline improved more in verbal learning compared with patients treated with  nortriptyline. Looking at change in cognition as a function of medication condition  and responder status revealed that sertraline responders improved more in verbal  learning compared with nortriptyline responders but not more than sertraline  non-responders or nortriptyline non-responders. Nortriptyline responders were the  only treatment by responder status group to show no improvement in verbal learning  from baseline to endpoint. CONCLUSIONS: Unexpectedly, nortriptyline responders  showed no improvement in verbal learning as compared with patients treated with  sertraline or nortriptyline non-responders. However, given the small sample sizes  and number of statistical tests (potential for type 1 error), replication is  warranted.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The future of psychotherapy research lies in the development of easy-to-use, efficient treatments that target specific characteristics and needs of  patients with a given disorder. Meeting this aim will involve understanding why  people seek psychotherapy and the therapeutic features that they feel are most  helpful in their recovery. Identifying key features of treatment that patients feel  lead to improvement may help identify the active ingredients of psychotherapy and  further refine treatment. DESIGN: We selected 22 older adults who participated in a  larger randomized trial of psychotherapy for late-life depression to participate in  individual, semistructured qualitative interviews. SETTING: Interviews took place at  the University of California, San Francisco or in the participant's home.  PARTICIPANTS: All participants were age 60 years or older with major depression and  co-occurring executive dysfunction. MEASUREMENTS: Participants were asked about  their depression experience, their expectations for treatment, most and least  helpful aspects of treatment, effects of treatment, and recommended improvements to  treatment. Data were transcribed, coded, and analyzed using NVivo (QSR  International, Cambridge, MA). RESULTS: The most commonly noted causes for seeking  treatment were depression related to interpersonal relationships, health conditions,  grief/loss, finances, housing, and challenges due to executive dysfunction.  Participants had few expectations about treatment and they found support, the  problem-solving therapy process, and focus on interpersonal relationships to be the  most helpful processes in treatment. CONCLUSION: Suggestions for psychotherapy  include increasing the number of sessions, discussing problems in a more proactive  way, and considering participant choice in treatment. This research demonstrates the  value of mixed-methods approaches, in that qualitative approaches assist in  contextualizing and interpreting quantitative data.},

The goal of this study was to discern the ways undergraduate preservice social studies teachers with different climate change beliefs read and evaluated the reliability of four diverse Web sources about the complex socioscientific topic of climate change. Findings highlight clear alignment between most participants with climate change beliefs at either end of a beliefs continuum with less alignment for participants with climate change beliefs toward the middle of a continuum. Findings also point to the benefits of whole group deliberation to help participants more critically evaluate a Web source that opposed the scientific consensus about climate change. In an age of “alternative facts,” this study points to the importance of students and educators having opportunities to evaluate, discuss, and determine the credibility of a range of online sources.},

  abstract = {Background.{$\quad$} On 7 February 2020, French Health authorities were informed of a confirmed case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in an Englishman infected in Singapore who had recently stayed in a chalet in the French Alps. We conducted an investigation to identify secondary cases and interrupt transmission. Methods.{$\quad$} We defined as a confirmed case a person linked to the chalet with a positive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction sample for SARS-CoV-2. Results.{$\quad$} The index case stayed 4 days in the chalet with 10 English tourists and a family of 5 French residents; SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 5 individuals in France, 6 in England (including the index case), and 1 in Spain (overall attack rate in the chalet: 75\%). One pediatric case, with picornavirus and influenza A coinfection, visited 3 different schools while symptomatic. One case was asymptomatic, with similar viral load as that of a symptomatic case. Seven days after the first cases were diagnosed, 1 tertiary case was detected in a symptomatic patient with from the chalet a positive endotracheal aspirate; all previous and concurrent nasopharyngeal specimens were negative. Additionally, 172 contacts were monitored; all contacts tested for SARS-CoV-2 (N = 73) were negative. Conclusions.{$\quad$} The occurrence in this cluster of 1 asymptomatic case with similar viral load as a symptomatic patient suggests transmission potential of asymptomatic individuals. The fact that an infected child did not transmit the disease despite close interactions within schools suggests potential different transmission dynamics in children. Finally, the dissociation between upper and lower respiratory tract results underscores the need for close monitoring of the clinical evolution of suspected cases of coronavirus disease 2019.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Late-life depression has been associated with frontostriatal abnormalities that are thought to lead to deficits of cognitive inhibition. However,  it remains unclear, whether age-of-onset identifies subgroups of depression. The  objective of this study was to compare cognitive inhibition in depressed women aged  60 and older, according to age of the first onset depression (before or after 60  years old). METHODS: We compared 10 currently depressed women (HDRS-17≥18) with a  late-onset depression to 10 depressed women with an early-onset depression, and to  10 healthy controls. We examined cognitive inhibition (Stroop, Hayling, Go/No-Go),  shifting (TMT), updating in working memory (WAIS) and executive functions (BREF).  All groups were matched for age, education level, and MMSE score (MMSE≥24). RESULTS:  Depressed elderly women with a late and an early-onset depression had a greater  impairment in executive functions and cognitive inhibition compared with healthy  controls (p{$<$}0,001), but without significant differences according to the age of the  first onset depression. Futhermore, late-onset depression in women was significantly  correlated with a deficit of cognitive inhibition (rs=0.55; p=0.012). CONCLUSION:  Cognitive inhibition should be assessed in late-life depression. Interventions may  be developed to specifically target cognitive impairment in the prevention of  late-life depression, to identify those who are the most vulnerable to relapse.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment associated with lifetime major depressive disorder (MDD) is well-supported by meta-analytic studies, but population-based estimates  remain scarce. Previous UK Biobank studies have only shown limited evidence of  cognitive differences related to probable MDD. Using updated cognitive and clinical  assessments in UK Biobank, this study investigated population-level differences in  cognitive functioning associated with lifetime MDD. METHODS: Associations between  lifetime MDD and cognition (performance on six tasks and general cognitive  functioning [g-factor]) were investigated in UK Biobank (N-range 7,457-14,836, age  45-81 years, 52\% female), adjusting for demographics, education, and lifestyle.  Lifetime MDD classifications were based on the Composite International Diagnostic  Interview. Within the lifetime MDD group, we additionally investigated relationships  between cognition and (a) recurrence, (b) current symptoms, (c) severity of  psychosocial impairment (while symptomatic), and (d) concurrent psychotropic  medication use. RESULTS: Lifetime MDD was robustly associated with a lower g-factor  (β~= -0.10, PFDR~= 4.7 × 10-5), with impairments in attention, processing speed, and  executive functioning (β~≥ 0.06). Clinical characteristics revealed differential  profiles of cognitive impairment among case individuals; those who reported severe  psychosocial impairment and use of psychotropic medication performed worse on  cognitive tests. Severe psychosocial impairment and reasoning showed the strongest  association (β~= -0.18, PFDR~=~7.5 × 10-5). CONCLUSIONS: Findings describe small but  robust associations between lifetime MDD and lower cognitive performance within a  population-based sample. Overall effects were of modest effect size, suggesting  limited clinical relevance. However, deficits within specific cognitive domains were  more pronounced in relation to clinical characteristics, particularly severe  psychosocial impairment.},

Selon le dictionnaire d'Oxford, qui en a fait son mot de l'année, le terme désignerait des « circonstances dans lesquelles les faits objectifs ont moins d'influence pour former l'opinion publique que l'appel à l'émotion et aux croyances personnelles ». Ce livre prend le parti de retourner à la source de cet état des lieux et l'identifie dans le concept de « bullshit » théorisé par le philosophe Harry Frankfurt en 1986. Ce qu'il a défini comme une « indifférence à l'égard de la vérité » distincte du mensonge s'avère en effet un outil conceptuel remarquablement efficace pour saisir comment l'opinion prétend l'emporter sur la vérité et pour comprendre le succès des impostures scientifiques et des « théories du complot ». L'ère de la~post-vérité est bien celle du bullshit institué à une échelle globale, et seule une compréhension fine de ce phénomène permettra d'engager la lutte qui se prépare. Heureusement, une telle science du bullshit est en fait déjà disponible, mais il restait à l'assembler en un seul volume accessible, utile et stimulant.},

The issue is highly relevant for Israel, a country that relies on the digital capabilities of its workers for its major technology industries and is also often a target of cyberwarfare and cybercrime attacks. The purpose of this study is to identify the determinants of cyber-safety behavior. We investigate the role of age, gender and education in the use of safety-related digital skills and antivirus software. Using a 2014 survey of a national sample of Internet users in Israel (N = 1850), we found that age, gender, education and quality of access are associated with the level of users’ digital security skills. In addition, these skills and the frequency of conducting financial activities online are the main determinants of antivirus behaviors. Our results expand the understanding of cyber-safety by showing that social and digital disparities are reproduced in the use of measures to prevent online threats, putting the digitally disadvantaged at greater risk of becoming victims of online threats.},

Objectives To investigate white-matter integrity differences, with and without comorbid pRBD and ICDs. Methods 149 de-novo PD patients and 30 age- and gender-matched controls from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative were studied. PD subjects were categorized into four groups with and without these comorbidities. We investigated the white matter integrity differences between these groups. Results PDs with only ICDs manifested greater fractional anisotropy (FA) and lower mean diffusivity (MD) in ipsilateral cerebellar connections when compared to controls and to Parkinson's with both comorbid disorders. In contrast, significantly lower FA and higher MD in the ipsilateral fornix-stria-terminalis was observed in PDs with only pRBD compared to controls and to PDs without either comorbid disorder. Also, PDs with only pRBD manifested greater FA in contralateral putamen when compared to controls. Conclusions Our results suggest the presence of an underlying neural network in PDs with ICDs, particularly involving cerebellar connections, which makes the subjects susceptible to pRBD. Lower white-matter integrity in the fornix of PDs with only pRBD suggests a neuropathological pathway specific to sleep behavior disorder, independent of impulse control disorders. Greater white-matter integrity observed in PDs without comorbid ICDs, regardless of their comorbid pRBD status, might reflect compensatory mechanisms. Targeted therapies for this particular neuropathology may help prevent these comorbidities.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Altered corticostriatothalamic encoding of reinforcement is a core feature of depression. Here we examine reinforcement learning in late-life  depression in the theoretical framework of the vascular depression hypothesis. This  hypothesis attributes the co-occurrence of late-life depression and poor executive  control to prefrontal/cingulate disconnection by vascular lesions. METHOD: Our fMRI  study compared 31 patients aged ⩾60 years with major depression to 16 controls.  Using a computational model, we estimated neural and behavioral responses to  reinforcement in an uncertain, changing environment (probabilistic reversal  learning). RESULTS: Poor executive control and depression each explained distinct  variance in corticostriatothalamic response to unexpected rewards. Depression, but  not poor executive control, predicted disrupted functional connectivity between the  striatum and prefrontal cortex. White-matter hyperintensities predicted diminished  corticostriatothalamic responses to reinforcement, but did not mediate effects of  depression or executive control. In two independent samples, poor executive control  predicted a failure to persist with rewarded actions, an effect distinct from  depressive oversensitivity to punishment. The findings were unchanged in a subsample  of participants with vascular disease. Results were robust to effects of confounders  including psychiatric comorbidities, physical illness, depressive severity, and  psychotropic exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to the predictions of the vascular  depression hypothesis, altered encoding of rewards in late-life depression is  dissociable from impaired contingency learning associated with poor executive  control. Functional connectivity and behavioral analyses point to a disruption of  ascending mesostriatocortical reward signals in late-life depression and a failure  of cortical contingency encoding in elderly with poor executive control.},

Converging evidence suggests that depression-related executive  dysfunction is greater at older ages, however, this has not been previously  confirmed by meta-analysis. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis,  using three-level models, on peer-reviewed studies that examined depression-related  differences in cognitive control in healthy community-dwelling individuals of any  age. We focused on studies of cognitive control as defined by the National Institute  of Mental Health (NIMH) Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework, which centers on  goal-directed behavior, such as goal selection (updating, representations,  maintenance), response selection (inhibition or suppression), and performance  monitoring. In 16,806 participants aged 7 to 97 across 76 studies, both clinical  depression and subthreshold depressive symptoms were associated with cognitive  control deficits (Hedges' g = -0.31). This relationship was stronger in study  samples with an older mean age. Within studies with a mean age of 39 years or  higher, which represents the median age in our analyses, the relationship was  stronger in clinical compared to subthreshold depression and in individuals taking  antidepressant medication. These findings highlight the importance of clinicians  screening for cognitive control dysfunction in patients with depression,  particularly in later stages of adulthood.},

  abstract = {Depression has been shown to negatively impact neurocognitive functions, particularly those governed by fronto-subcortical networks, such as executive  functions. Converging evidence suggests that depression-related executive  dysfunction is greater at older ages, however, this has not been previously  confirmed by meta-analysis. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis,  using three-level models, on peer-reviewed studies that examined depression-related  differences in cognitive control in healthy community-dwelling individuals of any  age. We focused on studies of cognitive control as defined by the National Institute  of Mental Health (NIMH) Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework, which centers on  goal-directed behavior, such as goal selection (updating, representations,  maintenance), response selection (inhibition or suppression), and performance  monitoring. In 16,806 participants aged 7 to 97 across 76 studies, both clinical  depression and subthreshold depressive symptoms were associated with cognitive  control deficits (Hedges' g = -0.31). This relationship was stronger in study  samples with an older mean age. Within studies with a mean age of 39 years or  higher, which represents the median age in our analyses, the relationship was  stronger in clinical compared to subthreshold depression and in individuals taking  antidepressant medication. These findings highlight the importance of clinicians  screening for cognitive control dysfunction in patients with depression,  particularly in later stages of adulthood.},

  abstract = {Probiotic treatment has been gaining attention due to its remarkable effects in alleviating toxicity and carcinogenesis. The novel strain Pediococcus pentosaceus GS4 has been reported for probiotic, survivability in simulated gastrointestinal fluid, and antioxidative and biohydrogenation properties. Therefore, we hypothesize that this specific strain might be able to assuage the effect of azoxymethane (AOM)-induced toxicity in mice. Twenty-eight Swiss albino mice were divided into 4 groups and were studied for-32 weeks. Azoxymethane (10 mg/kg body weight) was administered intraperitoneally twice (Oth and 14th days), and probiotic GS4 (1.1 x 10(9) colony-forming unit/mL) was given orally for the respective groups. Mice who served as the normal control received only normal saline. GS4-intervened AOM-induced mice showed marked improvement at the histopathologic level, in the liver and kidney. Moreover, probiotic GS4 intervention in AOM-induced mice exhibited a significant reduction in the liver function biomarker when compared with the AOM-induced mice. Probiotic GS4 intervention reduced the intestinal structural deformities as evident from the elevated brush border membrane-associated disaccharidases (sucrase, lactase) and intestinal alkaline phosphatase activities, which were found disrupted by AOM intoxication. Fecal bacterial load was found to be reduced in AOM-induced mice which were subsequently replenished by the probiotic GS4 intervention as apparent from the enhanced fecal bacterial load. There were no adverse effects observed in the probiotic control group. Conclusively, novel probiotic strain GS4 exhibited safe and beneficial effects against the toxicity threats posed by AOM. Thus, GS4 could be considered as a potential food supplement/additive for therapeutic purposes in gastrointestinal disorders related to inflammation and cancer. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

No previous study has compared the  cognitive effects of BF versus right unilateral (RUL) ECT by only including the  subgroup that is most likely to receive it: elderly patients with major depression.  METHODS: Nondemented patients (n = 65) with major depression, aged 60 to 85 years,  were randomly allocated to BF ECT and RUL formula-based ECT. Cognitive function was  assessed at baseline (T1), within 1 week after a course of ECT (T2), and 3 months  after T2 (T3). Six neuropsychological test measures of memory, 5 of executive  function, and 3 of information-processing speed were administered. RESULTS:  According to linear mixed models, there were no significant differences between the  BF and RUL groups at any time. The retrograde memory score for public facts declined  more for the RUL group (P {$<$} 0.001) than the BF group (P = 0.005) from baseline to  the first retest and remained stable for both groups from T2 to T3. A rapid  improvement in selective attention was observed in the RUL group from T1 to T2, but  the scores remained stable from T2 to T3 (P {$<$} 0.001). This measure remained stable  in the BF group from T1 to T3. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that there were  negligible differences in the cognitive effects of formula-based BF or RUL ECT.

Neuropsychological tests were  administered at the start of treatment and again within 1 week after treatment. We  computed reliable change indices (RCIs) using simple regression methods. RCIs are  statistical methods for analyzing change in individuals that have not yet been used  in studies of the acute cognitive side-effects of ECT. At the group level, only  letter fluency performance was found to be significantly reduced in the ECT group  compared with the controls, whereas both groups demonstrated stable or improved  performance on all other measures. At the individual level, however, 11\% of patients  showed retrograde amnesia for public facts post-ECT and 40\% of the patients showed a  significant decline in neuropsychological functioning. Decline on a measure of  delayed verbal anterograde memory was most common. Our findings indicate that there  are mild neurocognitive impairments in the acute phase for a substantial minority of  elderly patients receiving ECT.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective biological treatment option for severely depressed elderly patients; however, it can cause cognitive side  effects, including anterograde and retrograde amnesia. Elderly patients with  "cognitive impairment no dementia" (CIND) are reported as being more vulnerable to  the cognitive side effects of ECT compared with patients with "no cognitive  impairment" (NCI). The few studies that have reached this conclusion can be  criticized for using insensitive outcome measures. METHOD: The present study  investigated cognitive side effects using standard neuropsychological tests before  and after twice-weekly ECT. Patients were assessed at baseline (T1) and within one  week after a course of ECT (consisting of a mean of 10 treatments) (T2), and were  followed up for three months after T2 (T3). The sample included 54 patients with NCI  (n~=~36) or CIND (n~=~18). For a control group, we recruited 17 healthy elderly  persons. Tests of anterograde memory, information-processing speed, executive  function, and retrograde memory were administered. We computed reliable change  indices using simple regression methods. RESULTS: Short-term side effects were  detected at T2 in a large minority of patients, with no significant differences  between NCI and CIND patients. Considerable improvement in global cognitive function  from T1 to T3 was observed in 44\% of the CIND patients. At the group level,  information-processing speed improved significantly in CIND vs. NCI patients.  CONCLUSIONS: CIND patients were not more vulnerable to amnesia than were NCI  patients. Long-term cognitive side effects of ECT were not detected.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Five recent reviews have analyzed trials on the association between artificial food colors and ADHD; the 50 underlying studies and the reviews in aggregate were inconclusive. Recent work has shown human in vivo SULT1A inhibition leading to incremental catecholamines, and an inverted-U relationship between brain catecholamines and proper functioning of the prefrontal cortex where ADHD behavior can arise. METHOD: This study re-examined the same underlying trials for evidence that SULT1A inhibitors were in the placebos and other inactive foods, that these "inactive" materials were symptomatic, and that ADHD symptoms exhibited an inverted-U response to SULT1A inhibition. RESULTS: Nearly all the underlying diets, and many placebos and delivery vehicles, were found to contain SULT1A inhibitors. Eight publications provided evidence of ADHD symptoms caused by the "inactive" materials containing SULT1A inhibitors. Ten studies showed additional SULT1A inhibitors reducing the symptoms of some subjects. CONCLUSION: SULT1A inhibitors in foods, including natural substances and artificial food colors, have a role in ADHD that can both worsen or improve symptoms. Mechanistically, SULT1A enzymes normally deactivate catecholamines, especially dopamine formed in the intestines; SULT1A inhibition can influence brain catecholamines through the intermediary of plasma tyrosine levels, which are influenced by dopamine inhibition of intestinal tyrosine hydroxylase. Biochemical measurements focused on SULT1A activity and plasma tyrosine concentrations are proposed for future work.},

  abstract = {Tourette syndrome (TS) can feature complex tics involving socially inappropriate behaviours. Adults with TS can also demonstrate differences to healthy controls when  reasoning about mental states. This study investigated spontaneous mentalizing in  TS. Twenty adults with TS and twenty healthy controls completed the animations task.  Participants were asked to watch short ambiguous animations involving two triangles  and describe what was happening. Some animations featured random movement of the  triangles, while others depicted social interactions that were simple (e.g.,  dancing) or more complex (e.g., one triangle tricking the other). Measures were  taken of executive functions, alexithymia and clinical symptoms. Individuals with TS  responded similarly to controls when viewing animations featuring simple and complex  interactions, demonstrating intact mentalizing ability. However, significant group  differences were apparent for the random movement animations. TS was associated with  a greater tendency to attribute mental states during this condition, and to describe  random movements as motivated actions guided by the intentions of the triangles.  There were no group differences for the alexithymia scale, but TS was associated  with mild executive deficits. No relationships were apparent between animation  responses and other measures. Our findings suggest that TS is associated with a  propensity to adopt the intentional stance. Hyper-mentalizing in TS could be linked  to both dopamine dysfunction and altered social behaviour, whereby amplified  salience of social cues could contribute to the complex interplay between  environmental context and tic expression. These observations may offer further  insight into the potential effects of dopamine dysfunction on social cognition.},

This study  examined cognition in patients with late-life depression with a focus on the  assessment of the extent and type of memory loss among elderly depressed patients.  METHODS: Two-year cross-sectional study of elderly depressed (N = 112) and  nondepressed (N = 138) individuals at or older than 60 years in an urban area  surrounding a major medical center in southern California. Participants had little  to moderate stroke risk. Volunteers were screened with the Hamilton Depression  Rating Scale and the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical  Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) Axis I Disorders. Patients were  diagnosed for major depression by a geriatric psychiatrist using DSM-IV criteria.  Volunteers completed neuropsychological testing, a standard battery of laboratory  tests, and a neurologic and psychiatric evaluation to rule out a medical burden that  might contribute to depression or early dementia. RESULTS: Depressed patients showed  deficits in attention and processing, executive function, and immediate explicit  recall. Implicit learning and episodic recall of the testing procedure, semantic and  phonetic fluency, and retention of newly acquired verbal material after a delay  period were comparable with controls. CONCLUSION: Moderately depressed patients  demonstrate a pattern of cognitive deficits suggestive of mild frontal dysfunction  during recall tasks. Their retention of material over a delay period and their  intact language skills indicate medial hippocampal function similar to controls.  Subcortically mediated implicit memory is also at normal levels. These findings  support current efforts to identify pathways of frontal and/or striatal compromise  during depressive episodes.},

METHODS: Nondepressed  and depressed elders completed five executive tests, a standard panel of laboratory  tests and magnetic resonance imaging. Images of the prefrontal cortex were manually  masked and automatically segmented and regional brain volumes were calculated.  Executive scores and error rates were regressed on bilateral white and gray matter  volumes of anterior cingulate, gyrus rectus and orbitofrontal. RESULTS: Gyrus rectus  was associated positively with scores on sequencing and nonverbal abstract  reasoning, and negatively with two fluency error scores. Four positive interactions  indicated that performance of controls was more closely associated with increased  volume than that of depressed patients. Anterior cingulate was associated positively  with two nonverbal reasoning tasks and with three positive interactions.  Orbitofrontal volumes were negatively associated with correct responses and errors  on two fluency tasks. One interaction showed controls' performance decreased more  than depressed patients with increased volume. CONCLUSIONS: Individual executive  tasks correlate positively with volumes of anterior cingulate and gyrus rectus  regions and negatively with orbitofrontal region. The orbitofrontal relationship  suggests a loss of inhibitory control with decreased volume because both correct and  incorrect answers on fluency tasks increased per unit decrease in volume.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Previous studies of imaging predictors on acute treatment response in late-life depression (LLD) demonstrated that poor response to selective serotonin  reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is associated with pre-treatment low functional  connectivity (FC) within executive control network and high FC within default-mode  network including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). However, there is less  research in regional resting-state functional activity that explains FC changes  related to SSRI response. METHODS: Thirty-six older major depressive disorder (MDD)  patients not currently on antidepressant treatment had a baseline, pre-treatment  resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan, followed by sertraline  treatment for 12~weeks. Depression severity was assessed using the Montgomery-Åsberg  Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Subjects whose MADRS score decreased less than 50\%  from baseline or who discontinued sertraline for any reason were classified as  nonresponders (n~=~21). Subjects whose 12-week MADRS score dropped greater than or  equal to 50\% from baseline were defined as responders (n~=~15). We conducted the  amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI FC  analyses independently. Significance threshold was set at P~{$<~$}0.05 with false  discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: Relative to the  responder group, the nonresponder group showed significantly less ALFF in the  dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and greater ALFF in the vmPFC/subgenual  cingulate area. For ROI-to-ROI connectivity, there was significantly greater  connectivity between the vmPFC and the cerebellar vermis in the nonresponder group.  CONCLUSION: Our study highlighted the association of vmPFC resting-state activity  and connectivity with SSRI response. Future studies are warranted for understanding  the role of vmPFC-vermis connectivity in LLD.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Depressive disorder is commonly associated with impaired cognitive function; however, it is unclear whether the age of onset of the first episode of  depression, current depression severity, or historical severity of depressive  episodes are associated with cognitive performance. METHODS: This study examined  baseline cross-sectional data from the ongoing online PROTECT study. A total of 7344  participants, 50~years or older, with a history of depression and no diagnosis of  dementia were divided into three groups according to age of onset of their first  depressive episode: early-onset, midlife-onset, and late-onset. Performance on  measures of visuospatial episodic memory, executive function, verbal working, and  visual working memory were evaluated. Demographic and clinical characteristics such  as age, education, and severity of symptoms during their worst previous depressive  episode and current depression severity were included in multivariate regression  models. RESULTS: The late-onset depression group scored significantly lower on the  verbal reasoning task than the early-onset group while there were no significant  differences found on the other tasks. Midlife-onset depression participants  performed better in the visual episodic memory task, but worse on the verbal  reasoning task, than early-onset depression participants. Current depression  severity was negatively correlated with all four cognitive domains, while historical  severity score was found to be significantly associated with cognitive performance  on the verbal reasoning and spatial working memory tasks. CONCLUSIONS: The most  important indicator of cognitive performance in depression appears to be current,  rather than historic depression severity; however, late-onset depression may be  associated with more executive impairment than an early-onset depression.},

Intervention studies  support more potent effects of physical activity on EF among clinically depressed  older adults, although these results may have limited generalizability to the daily  mood and physical activity of healthy, community-dwelling older adults. METHODS: The  current study aimed to test whether physical activity among older adults was more  protective of EF during periods of cognitive vulnerability due to mildly elevated  depressive symptoms. Longitudinal data from 150 generally healthy,  community-dwelling older adults were collected semiannually and analyzed with  multilevel modeling. RESULTS: Physical activity was more protective of EF within  individuals during periods of relatively elevated depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS:  The power of physical activity to protect EF during periods of cognitive  vulnerability may extend to community-dwelling older adults with nonclinical levels  of depressive symptoms.},

A wealth of data pointed out that various aspects of chronic inflammation may be affected by several specific dietary factors. This paper calls attention to anthocyanins enriched plant food and anthocyanin dietary supplements, whose role in the management of IBD and its associated oncogenesis deems crucial. Area covered: We updated the most relevant dietary anthocyanins with potential anti-colitis and preventive effect on inflammatory associated colorectal cancer based on the recent animal and human researches along with revealing the major cellular and molecular mechanisms of action. Mounting evidence reported that anthocyanins enriched plant foods perform their protective role on IBD and inflammatory-induced colorectal cancer via different cellular transduction signaling pathways, including inflammatory transcription factors, SAPK/JNK and p38 MAPK cascade, JAK/STAT signaling, NF-kB/pERK/MAPK, Wnt signaling pathway, Nrf2 cytoprotective pathway as well as AMPK pathway and autophagy. Expert commentary: Combination of anthocyanins enriched dietary supplements with existing medications can provide new therapeutic options for IBD patients. Further, well-designed randomized control trials (RCTs) are essential to evaluate the role of anthocyanins enriched medicinal foods as well as isolated anthocyanin components as promising preventive and therapeutic dietary agents for IBD and its associated oncogenesis.},

  abstract = {Impaired visual search is a hallmark of spatial neglect. When searching for an unique feature (e.g., color) neglect patients often show only slight visual field asymmetries. In contrast, when the target is defined by a combination of features (e.g., color and form) they exhibit a severe deficit of contralesional search. This finding suggests a selective impairment of the serial deployment of spatial attention. Here, we examined this deficit with a preview paradigm. Neglect patients searched for a target defined by the conjunction of shape and color, presented together with varying numbers of distracters. The presentation time was varied such that on some trials participants previewed the target together with same-shape/different-color distracters, for 300 or 600 ms prior to the appearance of additional different-shape/same-color distracters. On the remaining trials the target and all distracters were shown simultaneously. Healthy participants exhibited a serial search strategy only when all items were presented simultaneously, whereas in both preview conditions a pop-out effect was observed. Neglect patients showed a similar pattern when the target was presented in the right hemifield. In contrast, when searching for a target in the left hemifield they showed serial search in the no-preview condition, as well as with a preview of 300 ms, and partly even at 600 ms. A control experiment suggested that the failure to fully benefit from item preview was probably independent of accurate perception of time. Our results, when viewed in the context of existing literature, lead us to conclude that the visual search deficit in neglect reflects two additive factors: a biased representation of attentional priority in favor of ipsilesional information and exaggerated capture of attention by ipsilesional abrupt onsets.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the range of available, evidence-based treatment options for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), the rather low response and remission rates suggest  that treatment is not optimal, yet. Computerized attention bias modification (ABM)  trainings may have the potential to be provided as cost-effective intervention as  adjunct to usual care (UC), by speeding up recovery and bringing more patients into  remission. Research suggests, that a selective attention for negative information  contributes to development and maintenance of depression and that reducing this  negative bias might be of therapeutic value. Previous ABM studies in depression,  however, have been limited by small sample sizes, lack of long-term follow-up  measures or focus on sub-clinical samples. This study aims at evaluating the  long-term (cost-) effectiveness of internet-based ABM, as add-on treatment to UC in  adult outpatients with MDD, in a specialized mental health care setting.  METHODS/DESIGN: This study presents a double-blind randomized controlled trial in  two parallel groups with follow-ups at 1, 6, and 12~months, combined with an  economic evaluation. One hundred twenty six patients, diagnosed with MDD, who are  registered for specialized outpatient services at a mental health care organization  in the Netherlands, are randomized into either a positive training (towards positive  and away from negative stimuli) or a sham training, as control condition (continuous  attentional bias assessment). Patients complete eight training sessions (seven at  home) during a period of two weeks (four weekly sessions). Primary outcome measures  are change in attentional bias (pre- to post-test), mood response to stress (at  post-test) and long-term effects on depressive symptoms (up to 1-year follow-up).  Secondary outcome measures include rumination, resilience, positive and negative  affect, and transfer to other cognitive measures (i.e., attentional bias for verbal  stimuli, cognitive control, positive mental imagery), as well as quality of life and  costs. DISCUSSION: This is the first study investigating the long-term effects of  ABM in adult outpatients with MDD, alongside an economic evaluation. Next to  exploring the mechanism underlying ABM effects, this study provides first insight  into the effects of combining ABM and UC and the potential implementation of ABM in  clinical practice.

  abstract = {Neurobiological models to explain vulnerability of major depressive disorder (MDD) are scarce and previous functional magnetic resonance imaging studies mostly  examined "static" functional connectivity (FC). Knowing that FC constantly evolves  over time, it becomes important to assess how FC dynamically differs in remitted-MDD  patients vulnerable for new depressive episodes. Using a recently developed method  to examine dynamic FC, we characterized re-emerging FC states during rest in 51  antidepressant-free MDD patients at high risk of recurrence (≥2 previous episodes),  and 35 healthy controls. We examined differences in occurrence, duration, and  switching profiles of FC states after neutral and sad mood induction. Remitted MDD  patients showed a decreased probability of an FC state (p\,{$<$}\,0.005) consisting of an  extensive network connecting frontal areas-important for cognitive control-with  default mode network, striatum, and salience areas, involved in emotional and  self-referential processing. Even when this FC state was observed in patients, it  lasted shorter (p\,{$<$}\,0.005) and was less likely to switch to a smaller  prefrontal-striatum network (p\,{$<$}\,0.005). Differences between patients and controls  decreased after sad mood induction. Further, the duration of this FC state increased  in remitted patients after sad mood induction but not in controls (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). Our  findings suggest reduced ability of remitted-MDD patients, in neutral mood, to  access a clinically relevant control network involved in the interplay between  externally and internally oriented attention. When recovering from sad mood,  remitted recurrent MDD appears to employ a compensatory mechanism to access this FC  state. This study provides a novel neurobiological profile of MDD vulnerability.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Emotional distress is common in people with epilepsy (PWE) for which efficacious interventions are required. Developing evidence-based treatments should  be based on testable models of the psychological mechanisms maintaining  psychopathology. The Self-Regulatory Executive Function (S-REF) model proposes that  maladaptive metacognitive beliefs and processes are central to the development and  maintenance of emotional distress. Although preliminary support exists for the role  of metacognitive beliefs in emotional distress in PWE, their role has yet to be  tested when controlling for the contribution made by illness perceptions. METHODS:  Four hundred and fifty-seven PWE completed an online survey, which assessed anxiety,  depression, metacognitive beliefs, illness perceptions, general demographic factors,  and epilepsy characteristics. RESULTS: Hierarchical regression analyses demonstrated  that metacognitive beliefs and illness perceptions were both associated with anxiety  and depression when controlling for the influence of demographic variables and  epilepsy characteristics. However, metacognitive beliefs accounted for more variance  in anxiety and depression than illness perceptions. CONCLUSION: Metacognitive  beliefs appear to make a greater contribution to anxiety and depression in PWE than  illness perceptions. Prospective studies are now needed to establish the causal role  of metacognitive beliefs in both the development and persistence of emotional  distress.},

The author will show that CRT scores are predictive of the types of choices that feature prominently in tests of decision-making theories, like expected utility theory and prospect theory. Indeed, the relation is sometimes so strong that the preferences themselves effectively function as expressions of cognitive ability—an empirical fact begging for a theoretical explanation. The author examines the relation between CRT scores and two important decision-making characteristics: time preference and risk preference. The CRT scores are then compared with other measures of cognitive ability or cognitive "style." The CRT scores exhibit considerable difference between men and women and the article explores how this relates to sex differences in time and risk preferences. The final section addresses the interpretation of correlations between cognitive abilities and decision-making characteristics.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Cognitive impairment associated with late-life depression can persist after remission of mood symptoms. Apathy, a common symptom of late-life depression,  often leads to worse clinical outcomes. We examined if severity of apathy mediates  cognitive difficulties in a cohort of older adults with major depression. METHODS:  One hundred thirty-eight older adults with depression (54.4\% female; mean [SD] age:  69.7 [7.4] years; mean [SD] education:15.6 [2.7] years) were recruited to  participate in a treatment study, and only baseline data were analyzed. All  participants received a comprehensive evaluation of depression, apathy, and  cognition. We examined whether apathy mediated the relationship between depression  and cognition, focusing our attention on memory and cognitive control. We then  explored whether the mediation effects differed across women and men. RESULTS:  Increased apathy was significantly associated with worse depression and lower  performance in the cognitive control domain but not in memory. Higher depressive  scores were significantly associated with worse cognitive control but not memory.  Mediation analyses revealed a significant indirect effect on cognitive control by  depression through increased apathy scores with the mediator accounting for 21\% of  the total effect. Stratifying by sex, we found that women exhibited a significant  indirect effect, with the mediator accounting for 47\% of the total effect, whereas  there was no mediation by apathy in men. CONCLUSIONS: The findings imply that  increased apathy mediates the relationship between cognition and depression. The  identification of mediating effects may inform future treatment strategies and  preventive interventions that can focus on decreasing apathy to improve cognition in  late-life depression.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Late-life depression (LLD) has been associated with alterations in intrinsic functional networks, best characterized in the default mode network (DMN),  cognitive control network (CCN), and salience network. However, these findings often  derive from small samples, and it is not well understood how network findings relate  to clinical and cognitive symptomatology. METHODS: We studied 100 older adults (n~=  79 with LLD, n~= 21 nondepressed) and collected resting-state functional magnetic  resonance imaging, clinical measures of depression, and performance on cognitive  tests. We selected canonical network regions for each intrinsic functional network  (DMN, CCN, and salience network) as seeds in seed-to-voxel analysis. We compared  connectivity between the depressed and nondepressed groups and correlated  connectivity with depression severity among depressed subjects. We then investigated  whether the observed connectivity findings were associated with greater severity of  common neuropsychiatric symptoms or poorer cognitive performance. RESULTS: LLD was  characterized by decreased DMN connectivity to the frontal pole, a CCN region (Wald  χ(2)(1)~= 22.33, p {$<$} .001). No significant group differences in connectivity were  found for the CCN or salience network. However, in the LLD group, increased CCN  connectivity was associated with increased depression severity (Wald χ(2)(1) {$>$}  20.14, p {$<$} .001), greater anhedonia (Wald χ(2)(1)~= 7.02, p~= .008) and fatigue  (Wald χ(2)(1)~= 6.31, p~= .012), and poorer performance on tests of episodic memory  (Wald χ(2)(1) {$>$} 4.65, p {$<$} .031), executive function (Wald χ(2)(1)~= 7.18, p~= .007),  and working memory (Wald χ(2)(1) {$>$} 4.29, p {$<$} .038). CONCLUSIONS: LLD is  characterized by differences in DMN connectivity, while CCN connectivity is  associated with LLD symptomology, including poorer performance in several cognitive  domains.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Both executive dysfunction (ED), measured by performance-based tasks, and dysexecutive behavior (DB), measured by behavioral rating scales, contribute to  late-life depression and comorbid disability. There is a modest positive association  of ED and DB, but less is known about their relative contributions to core aspects  of neuropsychiatric conditions and whether they provide unique or redundant  information. METHODS: Latent variable analyses were applied to ED, DB, depression,  and disability data from 220 older patients with major depression and ED who had  been enrolled in a psychosocial treatment study of depression. ED measures included  the Trail Making Test, part B, Stroop Color Word Interference Test, and Hopkins  Verbal Learning Test-Trail 1. The ED scale from the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale,  self and other-rated, served as the ratings-based measure of DB. RESULTS: The  measurement model, with all four latent variables related to one another,  demonstrated good fit (RMSEA=0.06). In the structural models, DB was associated with  both depression (β=0.61) and disability (β=0.42), whereas ED was associated with  depression (β=0.43) but not disability (β=0.16). Social problem-solving accounted  for 49\% of the influence of DB on late-life depression, whereas ED was not related  to social problem-solving. CONCLUSION: ED and the lesser studied DB measures offer  unique and complementary information. DB was robustly associated with late-life  depression and disability. Patients with depression and ED may be more likely to  develop disability when they exhibit DB and social problem-solving difficulties.},

  abstract = {Many immunotherapies act by enhancing the ability of cytotoxic T cells to kill tumor cells. Killing depends on T cell recognition of antigens presented by class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I) proteins on tumor cells. In this study, we showed that medulloblastomas lacking the p53 tumor suppressor do not express surface MHC-I and are therefore resistant to immune rejection. Mechanistically, this is because p53 regulates expression of the peptide transporter Tap1 and the aminopeptidase Erap1, which are required for MHC-I trafficking to the cell surface. In vitro, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or lymphotoxin-β receptor agonist can rescue expression of Erap1, Tap1 and MHC-I on p53-mutant tumor cells. In vivo, low doses of TNF prolong survival and synergize with immune checkpoint inhibitors to promote tumor rejection. These studies identified p53 as a key regulator of immune evasion and suggest that TNF could be used to enhance sensitivity of tumors to immunotherapy.},

  abstract = {Heart failure (HF) is associated with high rates of depression. In turn, depression is associated with reduced heart rate variability (HRV), a marker of parasympathetic  dysfunction and poorer cardiac outcomes. Cognitive impairment--especially executive  dysfunction--is also highly prevalent in HF, but it is unknown whether executive  function (EF) impacts the depression-HRV relationship. The primary objective of this  paper is to examine whether EF moderates the relationship between depression and HRV  in HF. Participants were 109 HF patients. Depressive symptoms were measured using  the Beck Depression Inventory-II. EF was assessed using a composite of age-adjusted  T scores on the Frontal Assessment Battery, Trail Making Test B, and Stroop Color  Word subtest. Parasympathetic function was assessed using resting high frequency HRV  (HF-HRV). Multiple hierarchical regression was used to conduct BDI × EF moderation  analyses. BDI scores were associated with reduced resting HF-HRV (p {$<$} .05). No main  effects were detected between EF and resting HF-HRV (p {$>$} .05). However, EF moderated  the relationship between BDI scores and resting HF-HRV (β = 0.59, p {$<$} .01). Simple  slope analyses revealed that among participants with poorer EF, higher BDI scores  were associated with lower resting HF-HRV (p {$<$} .001). Structural brain changes  common in HF may contribute to lower EF, increased depression, and poorer autonomic  functioning. Alternatively, the results may indicate that individuals with intact EF  engage in self-care strategies that negate the detrimental impact of depression on  autonomic function. Additional work is needed to clarify these possibilities and the  potential benefits of treating depression in HF patients with different cognitive  abilities.},

  abstract = {Background: The purpose of this research was to study the effectiveness of the overall dietary intervention rather than a single nutrient on children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Methods: This is a randomized controlled trial conducted at a child psychiatry clinic in Iran. Participants were 106 children and adolescents with ADHD. One group received methylphenidate plus dietary recommendations, while the other group only received methylphenidate. ADHD DSM-IV checklist was used to assess inattentiveness and hyperactivity/impulsivity scores at baseline and at the end of the trial. Results: The results revealed no significant difference between the two groups regarding mean age, gender ratio, body mass index, baseline inattentiveness score, and baseline hyperactivity score. Linear regression analysis considering the covariant variables showed that the inattentive score at the end of the trial was significantly associated with the mean change of favorite diet scores. Conclusion: This is the first clinical trial examining the effect of overall dietary characteristics rather than a single nutrient on the children formally diagnosed with ADHD. According to the results, un-favorite diet had no effects on inattentive or hyperactivity/impulsivity score. Encouraging the children with ADHD to increase their intake of recommended diet markedly improves their attention.},

  abstract = {AIMS: To identify baseline clinical factors associated with acute treatment response in depressed older adults with bipolar disorder (BD) receiving lamotrigine. METHODS:  Secondary analysis of a multisite, 12-week, open-label, uncontrolled study of add-on  lamotrigine in 57 adults 60 years and older with BD I or II depression. Measures  included the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Young Mania  Rating Scale (YMRS). Cardiometabolic risk was measured with total serum cholesterol  and the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale-Geriatric (CIRS-G) item \#13  (endocrine/metabolic burden). Neurocognitive (executive) function was evaluated  using the Trail Making Test. RESULTS: Greater reduction in MADRS from baseline was  associated with higher baseline cardiometabolic burden at 6 and 9 weeks and lower  YMRS scores at 9 weeks. At 12 weeks, improvement in the MADRS from baseline was no  longer significantly related to baseline cardiometabolic burden or YMRS scores. A  longitudinal mixed model of MADRS scores corroborated these findings with a  significant finding of time-by-baseline cholesterol level interaction. In a subset  of participants, better baseline executive function was related to greater  improvement in the MADRS at 9 weeks but not at 6 or 12 weeks. Among all  participants, higher baseline YMRS scores were related to greater likelihood of  dropout. CONCLUSIONS: Lamotrigine appears to work best in depressed elderly patients  with BD who have high cardiometabolic risk and low level of mania. Agents like  lamotrigine that act primarily on neuroprogressive pathways involving oxidative  stress, neurotrophins, and inflammation may be particularly effective in individuals  with BD who have significant cardiometabolic burden because of their effects on  shared vulnerability factors in BD and medical illness.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Depression frequently co-occurs with cognitive decline, but the nature of this association is unclear. We examined relations of late-life depressive  symptom patterns to subsequent domain-specific cognitive changes. METHODS:  Depressive symptoms were measured at up to 3 timepoints among 11,675 Nurses' Health  Study participants prior to cognitive testing. Depressive symptom patterns were  categorized as non-depressed, variable or persistent, based on published severity  cutpoints. Outcomes were global, verbal, and executive function-attention composite  scores. RESULTS: Participants with persistent depressive symptoms had worse  executive function-attention decline compared with non-depressed participants  (multivariable-adjusted mean difference\,=\,-0.03 units/year, 95\% CI: -0.05, -0.01;  p\,=\,0.003); this difference was comparable with 8\,years of aging. However, being in  the persistent versus non-depressed group was not significantly related to verbal  (p\,=\,0.71) or global score (p\,=\,0.09) decline. By contrast, compared with the  non-depressed group, those with variable depressive symptoms had worse verbal memory  decline (multivariable-adjusted mean difference\,=\,-0.01 units/year, 95\% CI: -0.02,  -0.002; p\,=\,0.03); this group showed no differences for global or executive  function-attention decline. CONCLUSIONS: A variable pattern of depressive symptom  severity related to subsequent decline in verbal memory, while a persistent pattern  related to decline in executive function-attention. Findings could signal  differences in underlying neuropathologic processes among persons with differing  depression patterns and late-life cognitive decline.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Late-life depression (LLD) is a common and debilitating condition among older adults. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has strong empirical support for  the treatment of depression in all ages, including in LLD. In teaching patients to  identify, monitor, and challenge negative patterns in their thinking, CBT for LLD  relies heavily on cognitive processes and, in particular, executive functioning,  such as planning, sequencing, organizing, and selectively inhibiting information. It  may be that the effectiveness of CBT lies in its ability to train these cognitive  areas. METHODS: Participants with LLD completed a comprehensive neuropsychological  battery before enrolling in CBT. The current study examined the relationship between  neuropsychological function prior to treatment and response to CBT. RESULTS: When  using three baseline measures of executive functioning that quantify set shifting,  cognitive flexibility, and response inhibition to predict treatment response, only  baseline Wisconsin Card Sort Task performance was associated with a significant drop  in depression symptoms after CBT. Specifically, worse performance on the Wisconsin  Card Sort Task was associated with better treatment response. CONCLUSIONS: These  results suggest that CBT, which teaches cognitive techniques for improving  psychiatric symptoms, may be especially beneficial in LLD if relative weaknesses in  specific areas of executive functioning are present.},

In the course of the analysis, we explain why Adar and Huberman’s previous use of Hardin’s Tragedy to interpret certain recent phenomena in the Infosphere (especially peer-to-peer communication) may not be entirely satisfactory. We then seek to provide an improved version of the TDC that avoids the possible shortcomings of their model. Next, we analyse some problems encountered by the application of classical ethics in the resolution of the TDC. In the conclusion, we outline the kind of work that will be required to develop an ethical approach that may bridge the digital divide but avoid the TDC.},

  abstract = {Objective To describe and discuss the process used to write a narrative review of the literature for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Publication of narrative overviews of the literature should be standardized to increase their objectivity. Background In the past decade numerous changes in research methodology pertaining to reviews of the literature have occurred. These changes necessitate authors of review articles to be familiar with current standards in the publication process. Methods Narrative overview of the literature synthesizing the findings of literature retrieved from searches of computerized databases, hand searches, and authoritative texts. Discussion An overview of the use of three types of reviews of the literature is presented. Step by step instructions for how to conduct and write a narrative overview utilizing a ‘best-evidence synthesis’ approach are discussed, starting with appropriate preparatory work and ending with how to create proper illustrations. Several resources for creating reviews of the literature are presented and a narrative overview critical appraisal worksheet is included. A bibliography of other useful reading is presented in an appendix. Conclusion Narrative overviews can be a valuable contribution to the literature if prepared properly. New and experienced authors wishing to write a narrative overview should find this article useful in constructing such a paper and carrying out the research process. It is hoped that this article will stimulate scholarly dialog amongst colleagues about this research design and other complex literature review methods.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Depression and cognitive impairment are highly prevalent in later life and frequently co-occur. Structural changes in critical brain regions may underlie  both conditions. The authors examined associations of infarcts, white-matter lesions  (WML) and atrophy at different locations with depressive symptoms and cognitive  functioning. METHODS: Within the Second Manifestations of Arterial Disease-Memory,  Depression and Aging (SMART-Medea) study, cross-sectional analyses were performed in  585 non-demented patients aged ≥50 years with symptomatic atherosclerotic disease.  Volumetric measures of WML and atrophy were obtained with 1.5 T MRI; infarcts were  rated visually. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health  Questionnaire-9 (score ≥6). z Scores of executive functioning, memory and processing  speed were calculated. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, education, intelligence,  vascular disease, physical functioning and co-occurring brain changes. RESULTS:  Depressive symptoms were present in 102 (17\%) patients and were associated with  poorer memory (B=-0.26, 95\% CI -0.47 to -0.06). Large subcortical infarcts and  lacunar infarcts in deep white-matter tracts were both associated with depressive  symptoms (RR=2.66, 95\% CI 1.28 to 5.54; RR=2.02, 95\% CI 1.14 to 3.59) and poorer  executive functioning and memory. Periventricular WML volume was associated with  poorer executive functioning; cortical infarcts in the left hemisphere and media  flow region, ventricular volume and cortical atrophy were associated with a slower  processing speed. CONCLUSION: In this sample of non-demented older persons,  subcortical infarcts contributed to an increased risk of depressive symptoms as well  as cognitive impairment. This depended on location in projecting white-matter  tracts, and not on infarct size.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Cognitive impairment has been associated with late-life suicidal behavior. Without longitudinal data it is unclear whether these are transient  features of a depressive state or stable impairments. We examined longitudinally the  course of cognitive impairment in older adults with depression and a history of  suicide attempt. METHODS: We investigated the persistence of cognitive impairment  over time in 198 depressed older adults (age {$>$}60); 91 suicide attempters, 39  depressed individuals with suicidal ideation (ideators), and 68 non-suicidal  depressed adults assessed over a 2-year period at four time points. We used linear  mixed effects modeling to examine group differences in trajectories of cognitive  decline over 2\,years, using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Mattis  Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), and Executive Interview (EXIT). RESULTS: Over the  2-year period, suicide attempters performed significantly worse than both suicide  ideators and non-suicidal depressed older adults on the MMSE (mean difference: from  ideators: -0.88, p\,=\,0.02; from non-suicidal depressed: -1.52, p\,{$<$}\,0.01), while on  the EXIT and DRS, suicide attempters performed significantly worse than non-suicidal  depressed older adults (mean difference: in EXIT: -1.75, p\,=\,0.01; in DRS: 3.04,  p\,{$<$}\,0.01; in MMSE: 1.15, p\,{$<$}\,0.01). Cognitive impairment in suicide attempters  partly resolved, as indicated by a group\,×\,time interaction on the DRS (p\,=\,0.039),  but not the EXIT (p\,=\,0.58) or the MMSE (p\,=\,0.08). CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive  impairment in late-life suicidal behavior appears to involve both a stable and a  state-related component.},

We further explored whether patient  characteristics, such as age, sex, and additional cognitive impairment load (e.g.,  memory impairments) were related to changes in suicidal ideation over time. DESIGN:  Secondary data analysis using data from a randomized clinical trial allocating  participants to PST or ST at 1:1 ratio. Raters were blind to patients' assignments.  SETTING: University medical centers. PARTICIPANTS: 221 people aged 65 years old and  older with major depression determined by Structured Clinical Interview for  DSM-III-R diagnosis and executive dysfunction as defined by a score of 33 or less on  the Initiation-Perseveration Score of the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale or a Stroop  Interference Task score of 25 or less. INTERVENTIONS: 12 weekly sessions of PST or  ST. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The suicide item of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.  RESULTS: Of the 221 participants, 61\% reported suicidal ideation (SI). The ST group  had a lower rate of improvement in SI after 12 weeks (44.6\%) than did the PST group  (60.4\%, Fisher's exact test p = 0.031). Logistic regression showed significantly  greater reductions in SI in elders who received PST at both 12 weeks (OR: .50, Z =  -2.16, p = 0.031) and 36 weeks (OR: 0.5, Z = -1.96, p = 0.05) after treatment.

Neurotoxicity is associated with cytokine release syndrome, which occurs in the setting of in-vivo chimeric antigen receptor-T cell activation and proliferation. The mechanisms that lead to neurotoxicity remain unknown, but data from patients and animal models suggest there is compromise of the blood-brain barrier, associated with high levels of cytokines in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid, as well as endothelial activation. Corticosteroids, interleukin-6-targeted therapies, and supportive care are frequently used to manage patients with neurotoxicity, but high-quality evidence of their efficacy is lacking.},

Given the intensity of the stressor, its chronicity, and its  association with depression, it is important to know the impact CG may have on  cognitive functioning. This exploratory and descriptive study examined global and  domain-specific cognitive functioning in a help-seeking sample of individuals with  CG (n = 335) compared to a separately ascertained control sample (n = 250).  Cognitive functioning was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).  Controlling for age, sex and education effects, CG participants had lower total  MoCA, visuospatial and attention scores relative to control participants. The two  groups did not differ significantly in the domains of executive function, language,  memory or orientation. Age, sex, and education accounted for much of the variance in  MoCA scores, while CG severity and chronicity accounted for a very small percentage  of MoCA score variance. Major depression was not a significant predictor of MoCA  scores. This study is consistent with previous work demonstrating lower attention  and global cognitive performance in individuals with CG compared to control  participants. This study newly identifies the visuospatial domain as a target for  future studies investigating cognitive functioning in CG.},

  abstract = {Difficulty concentrating is one of the most common diagnostic criteria across DSM-5 categories, especially within the emotional (mood- and anxiety-related) disorders. A  substantial literature has characterized cognitive functioning in emotional  disorders using objective (behavioral) computerized cognitive tasks. However,  diagnoses are typically formed on the basis of subjective (self-reported;  clinician-rated) assessments of symptoms, and little is known about difficulty  concentrating as a symptom. These questions are particularly important for  generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), which has long been the subject of nosological  debates, and for which several theoretical models that suggest a central role for  cognitive impairments (including difficulty concentrating) in the maintenance of  psychopathology have been proposed. The present study evaluated the incremental  utility of difficulty concentrating and its relationship to worry and other symptoms  in 175 GAD-diagnosed adults. Clinician-assessed difficulty concentrating  incrementally predicted clinician-rated GAD, anxiety, and depression severity even  after other GAD symptoms were controlled. Consistent with theoretical models of GAD  that propose a direct relationship between worry and cognitive impairment,  difficulty concentrating mediated the relationship between trait worry and clinical  severity. These findings suggest that difficulty concentrating has value as a  diagnostic criterion and is a potential mechanism by which worry increases distress  and impairment.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Depression in late life has been associated with difficulties in cognitive processing, particularly in the domains of executive function, processing  speed and memory, and increases the risk of developing dementia suggesting a  neurodegenerative phenotype. Mitochondrial dysfunction is frequently an early event  in neurodegenerative illnesses and may be operative in patients with late life  depression. Phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P MRS) allows for the  quantification of bioenergetic molecules produced by mitochondria. METHODS: Ten  patients with late life depression and eight normal elderly controls were studied  with Stroop color and interference tests, which are widely used measures of  processing speed and executive function, respectively, followed by (31P) MRS  3-dimensional chemical-shift imaging measuring levels of adenosine triphosphate,  phosphocreatine, inorganic phosphate, and pH over the whole brain. RESULTS: In all  subjects, gray matter phosphocreatine was positively associated with Stroop  interference. Levels of white matter adenosine triphosphate were associated with  Stroop interference in subjects with late life depression but not normal elderly.  There was also a complementary association between white matter inorganic phosphate  and Stroop interference in late life depression patients. CONCLUSIONS: These  findings suggest two independent sources of executive function dependence on  bioenergetic state in the aging brain. The dependence of executive function  performance in subjects with late life depression on ATP in white matter may be  associated with mitochondrial impairment and is consistent with predictions of the  vascular depression hypothesis. Further research with wider neuropsychological  testing targeting bioenergetic markers could help clarify the scope of these  effects. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

METHOD:  Via the Danish registers (Civil Person Register, Danish Psychiatric Register) we  identified individuals between 40 and 80 years of age with a diagnosis of unipolar  disorder at their first discharge from a psychiatric hospital, and a gender- and  age-matched control group. Particular emphasis was placed on assuring that patients  were in a remitted state. Cognitive function was assessed with a broad range of  neuropsychological tests. RESULTS: A total of 88 patients and 50 controls were  included in the study. In multiple linear regression analyses with simultaneous  adjustment for age, gender, education level, premorbid IQ, and residual depressive  symptoms, a diagnosis of unipolar disorder predicted lower performance on the Trail  Making Test, the Symbol Digit Modalities Test, and on the Stroop test. CONCLUSION:  Cognitive deficits are present in patients with unipolar disorder in the remitted  state. The deficits seem to reside more within the cognitive domain of attention  than within other domains, and may be characterized by impairment of processing  speed and cognitive flexibility.},

  abstract = {Background: The Coloboma mouse carries a similar to 2 cM deletion encompassing the SNAP25 gene and has a hyperactive phenotype similar to that of ADHD. Such mice are 3 fold more active compared to their control littermates. Genetic association studies support a role for allelic variants of the human SNAP25 gene in predisposing to ADHD. Methods/Principal Findings: We performed association analysis across the SNAP25 gene in 1,107 individuals (339 ADHD trios). To assess the functional relevance of the SNAP25-ADHD associated allele, we performed quantitative PCR on postmortem tissue derived from the inferior frontal gyrus of 89 unaffected adults. Significant associations with the A allele of SNP rs362990 (chi(2) = 10, p-corrected = 0.019, OR = 1.5) and three marker haplotypes (rs6108461, rs362990 and rs362998) were observed. Furthermore, a significant additive decrease in the expression of the SNAP25 transcript as a function of the risk allele was also observed. This effect was detected at the haplotype level, where increasing copies of the ADHD-associated haplotype reduced the expression of the transcript. Conclusions: Our data show that DNA variation at SNAP25 confers risk to ADHD and reduces the expression of the transcript in a region of the brain that is critical for the regulation of attention and inhibition.},

We examined whether physical  stimulation interventions were effective in reducing cognitive, physical, mood, and  behavioral decline in nursing home residents with dementia. METHODS: Eighty-seven  nursing home residents with dementia were randomly assigned to 3 physical activity  interventions: activities of daily living (ADL) training, multicomponent exercise  training, or combined multicomponent exercise and ADL training. Outcomes were  measured at baseline, and after 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: A 6-month ADL training  benefitted executive functions, physical endurance, and depression among men.  Exercise training benefitted only grip strength of participants with  mild-to-moderate cognitive impairment. A combined training benefitted functional  mobility compared to ADL training, depressive symptoms and agitation compared to  exercise training, and physical endurance compared to no physical stimulation.  CONCLUSIONS: ADL training appears to be effective for nursing home residents with  moderately severe dementia. It remains unclear whether exercise training is an  effective type of stimulation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cognitive deficits and elevated cortisol are hallmarks of depression. Cortisol acts via mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors, which have their  highest density in the hippocampus, a brain area closely related to cognitive  function. Several studies have separately examined cortisol secretion and cognitive  deficits in depression. However, only few studies have assessed their association in  the same patients producing inconclusive results. METHODS: We examined 52  medication-free patients with major depression (37 women, 15 men; mean age 35 +/- 11  years; Hamilton Depression Scale mean score 27 +/- 5) and 50 healthy control  subjects, matched for age, gender, and years of education. We applied several  neuropsychological tests. Salivary cortisol levels were measured on the same day at  08:00, 12:00, 16:00, and 22:00 hours. RESULTS: Compared with healthy subjects,  patients had significantly higher cortisol levels and were impaired in verbal  memory, visuospatial memory, working memory, and selective attention. In depressed  patients, but not in healthy control subjects, we found a negative correlation  between salivary cortisol levels (area under the curve) and hippocampus-related  neuropsychological domains (verbal memory, visuospatial memory) and executive  function. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive deficits, especially those closely related to  hippocampus function, appear to be related to cortisol secretion in depressed  patients. Elevated cortisol may downregulate mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid  receptors in the hippocampus, which could, in part, be responsible for cognitive  deficits in depressed patients.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Depressive and anxiety symptoms are common in older adults, significantly affect quality of life, and are risk factors for Alzheimer's disease. We sought to  identify the determinants of predominant trajectories of depressive and anxiety  symptoms in cognitively normal older adults. METHOD: Four hundred twenty-three older  adults recruited from the general community underwent Aβ positron emission  tomography imaging, apolipoprotein and brain-derived neurotrophic factor genotyping,  and cognitive testing at baseline and had follow-up assessments. All participants  were cognitively normal and free of clinical depression at baseline. Latent growth  mixture modeling was used to identify predominant trajectories of subthreshold  depressive and anxiety symptoms over 6~years. Binary logistic regression analysis  was used to identify baseline predictors of symptomatic depressive and anxiety  trajectories. RESULTS: Latent growth mixture modeling revealed two predominant  trajectories of depressive and anxiety symptoms: a chronically elevated trajectory  and a low, stable symptom trajectory, with almost one in five participants falling  into the elevated trajectory groups. Male sex (relative risk ratio (RRR)~=~3.23),  lower attentional function (RRR~=~1.90), and carriage of the brain-derived  neurotrophic factor Val66Met allele in women (RRR~=~2.70) were associated with  increased risk for chronically elevated depressive symptom trajectory. Carriage of  the apolipoprotein epsilon 4 allele (RRR~=~1.92) and lower executive function in  women (RRR~=~1.74) were associated with chronically elevated anxiety symptom  trajectory. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate distinct and sex-specific risk factors  linked to depressive and anxiety trajectories, which may help inform risk  stratification and management of these symptoms in older adults at risk for  Alzheimer's disease.

The current study tested whether internet-delivered cognitive  control training (CCT) can be used as an intervention to increase resilience to  depression in RMD patients. METHOD: Effects of CCT were assessed using a  double-blind randomized controlled design. RMD patients performed 10 sessions of a  working memory-based CCT (N = 34) or a low cognitive load training (N = 34; active  control condition) over a period of 14 days. Assessments took place prior to  training, immediately following 2 weeks of training, and at 3 months follow-up.  Brooding and depressive symptomatology were selected as primary outcome measures,  alternative indicators for emotion regulation and residual symptomatology were  selected as secondary outcome measures, along with indicators of functioning.  RESULTS: Compared to an active control condition, CCT demonstrated beneficial  effects on a cognitive transfer task, brooding, depressive symptomatology, residual  complaints, self-reported use of general maladaptive emotion regulation strategies,  and resilience after controlling for intention to treat. Furthermore, completers of  the CCT reported a reduction in experienced disability and cognitive complaints.  However, no beneficial effects were found for self-reported use of adaptive emotion  regulation strategies. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of  CCT as an intervention to reduce cognitive vulnerability, residual symptomatology,  and foster resilience following recovery from depression. CCT thus holds potential  as a preventive intervention for RMD patients. (PsycINFO Database Record},

DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study. SUBJECTS: The subjects of  this study are patients who have suffered a stroke and who rehabilitated in the  nursing homes' rehabilitation units and patients (n\,=\,160) (mean age: 77; SD: 9.5)  with a mean Barthel Index of 11.02. METHOD: Demographic, illness-related, functional  and cognitive data were selected at baseline. MAIN ASSESSMENT MEASURES: Functional  abilities were tested using the Barthel Index. Cognitive functions were assessed  using a wide variety of neuropsychological tests. RESULTS: Patients faced cognitive  impairments especially in executive functioning and memory. Stepwise linear  regression analysis shows that executive functioning (p\,=\,0.050) and memory  (p\,=\,0.000; confidence interval -1.255, -0.403) are significantly associated with  functional outcome. CONCLUSION: From a clinical point of view, we suggest combining  physical and cognitive training from the very early phase of recovery.},

Notre analyse repose sur une étude comparative et transnationale de l’évaluation des biotechnologies, avec une focale sur les risques liés au clonage animal, en Europe et aux États-Unis. Quelles sont les connaissances produites en relation à un cadre réglementaire et institutionnel qu’elles contribuent à construire ? Nous identifions deux modes de production différenciés d’expertise scientifique dans lesquels la science réglementaire est plus ou moins centrale et qui associent différentes façons de produire de la connaissance (formes de raisonnement, traitement de l’incertitude, hiérarchie des sources de connaissance) et différentes façons de réguler les activités (architectures institutionnelles, ressources réglementaires, sources d’autorité). La production d’expertise s’avère donc prise dans l’ensemble des règles que forme cette « science réglementaire » qui, portant la marque des histoires nationales, entrave fortement les efforts d’harmonisation.},

This study empirically investigates such assumptions by assessing whether individuals with greater literacy (media, information, news, and digital literacies) are better at recognizing fake news, and which of these literacies are most relevant. The results reveal that information literacy—but not other literacies—significantly increases the likelihood of identifying fake news stories. Interpreting the results, we provide both conceptual and methodological explanations.

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}As children are under-represented in current studies aiming to analyse transmission of SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), their contribution to transmission is unclear. Viral load, as measured by RT-PCR, can inform considerations regarding transmission, especially if existing knowledge of viral load in other respiratory diseases is taken into account. RT-PCR threshold cycle data from 3303 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (out of 77,996 persons tested in total, drawn from across Germany) were analysed to examine the relationship between patient age and estimated viral load. Two PCR systems were used. In data from the PCR system predominantly used for community and cluster screening during the early phase of the epidemic (Roche LightCycler 480 II), when such screening was frequent practice, viral loads do not differ significantly in three comparisons between young and old age groups (differences in log\textsubscript{10} viral loads between young and old estimated from raw viral load data and a Bayesian mixture model of gamma distributions collectively range between −0.11 and −0.43). Data from a second type of PCR system (Roche cobas 6800/8800), introduced into diagnostic testing on March 16, 2020 and used during the time when household and other contact testing was reduced, show a credible but small difference in the three comparisons between young and old age groups (differences, measured as above, collectively range between −0.43 and −0.83). This small difference may be due to differential patterns of PCR instrument utilization rather than to an actual difference in viral load. Considering household transmission data on influenza, which has a similar viral load kinetic to SARS-CoV-2, the viral load differences between age groups observed in this study are likely to be of limited relevance. Combined data from both PCR instruments show that viral loads of at least 250,000 copies, a threshold we previously established for the isolation of infectious virus in cell culture at more than 5\% probability, were present across the study period in 29.0\% of kindergarten-aged patients 0-6 years old (n=38), 37.3\% of those aged 0-19 (n=150), and in 51.4\% of those aged 20 and above (n=3153). The differences in these fractions may also be due to differences in test utilization. We conclude that a considerable percentage of infected people in all age groups, including those who are pre- or mild-symptomatic, carry viral loads likely to represent infectivity. Based on these results and uncertainty about the remaining incidence, we recommend caution and careful monitoring during gradual lifting of non-pharmaceutical interventions. In particular, there is little evidence from the present study to support suggestions that children may not be as infectious as adults.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Its presence has been consistently  associated with cognitive impairment, greater disability and increased mortality.  Approximately half of patients with LLD have evidence of subcortical ischaemic  damage in prefrontal circuits revealed by MRI. This might constitute the biological  substrate of the cardinal symptoms of depression and of executive dysfunction. An  important proportion of patients with LLD do not achieve remission of their  depressive symptoms in spite of adequate pharmacological and psychotherapeutic  treatment. In addition, a group of LLD patients progress to further impairment and  disability in the form of a dementing disorder. There is an imperative need to  develop new treatment strategies for LLD. Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques  such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct  current stimulation (tDCS) are safe and efficacious interventions that might be used  in combination with other therapeutic options to improve treatment outcomes.  However, there are still questions regarding the optimal way in which rTMS and dTCS  should be delivered as well as to the way in which we may identify the subjects who  will benefit the most from these interventions.},

The first casts doubt on the existence of “curiosity” as a measurable disposition. The other suggests that individual differences in cognition related to science comprehension—of which science curiosity, if it exists, would presumably be one—do not mitigate politically biased information processing but instead aggravate it. The article describes the scale-development strategy employed to overcome the problems associated with measuring science curiosity. It also reports data, observational and experimental, showing that science curiosity promotes open-minded engagement with information that is contrary to individuals’ political predispositions. We conclude by identifying a series of concrete research questions posed by these results.},

In an experiment embedded within a nationally representative survey of youth ages 15 to 27 (N = 2,101), youth were asked to judge the accuracy of one of several simulated online posts. Consistent with research on motivated reasoning, youth assessments depended on (a) the alignment of the claim with one’s prior policy position and to a lesser extent on (b) whether the post included an inaccurate statement. To consider ways educators might improve judgments of accuracy, we also investigated the influence of political knowledge and exposure to media literacy education. We found that political knowledge did not improve judgments of accuracy but that media literacy education did.},

Symptoms of ADHD include hyperactivity, low frustration tolerance, impulsivity, and inattention. While the biological pathways leading to ADHD are not clearly delineated, a number of genetic and environmental risk factors for the disorder are recognized. In the early 1970s, research conducted by Dr. Benjamin Feingold found that when hyperactive children were given a diet free of artificial food additives and dyes, symptoms of hyperactivity were reduced. While some clinical studies supported these findings, more rigorous empirical studies conducted over the next 20 years were less positive. As a result, research on the role of food additives in contributing to ADHD waned. In recent years, however, interest in this area has revived. In response to more recent research and public petitions, in December 2009 the British government requested that food manufacturers remove most artificial food dyes from their products. While these strictures could have positive effects on behavior, the removal of food dyes is not a panacea for ADHD, which is a multifaceted disorder with both biological and environmental underpinnings.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Safe, efficacious, second-line pharmacological treatment options exist for the large portion of older adults with major depressive disorder who do not  respond to first-line pharmacotherapy. However, limited evidence exists to aid  clinical decision making regarding which patients will benefit from which  second-line treatments. OBJECTIVE: To test the moderating role of pretreatment  executive function, severity of anxiety, and severity of medical comorbidity in  remission of treatment-resistant late-life depression after aripiprazole  augmentation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: As follow-up to a 12-week  randomized clinical trial of aripiprazole augmentation for first-line  treatment-resistant late-life depression (Incomplete Response in Late-Life  Depression: Getting to Remission [IRL-GRey]), we evaluated the effects of the  following potential moderators and their interactions with treatment: baseline  assessments of executive function (set shifting measured by the Trail Making Test)  and response inhibition control (measured by a Color-Word Interference task),  anxiety symptoms, and medical comorbidity. Analyses were conducted in May and June  2015. INTERVENTIONS: Aripiprazole or placebo tablets were started at 2 mg daily and  titrated as tolerated, to a maximal dose of 15 mg daily. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:  Remission of treatment-resistant late-life depression (defined as a  Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale score of ≤10 at both of the last 2  consecutive visits). RESULTS: Of 181 trial participants (103 female [56.9\%]) who  were 60 years of age or older and whose major depression had failed to remit with  venlafaxine hydrochloride monotherapy, 91 received aripiprazole and 90 received  placebo. Remission occurred in 40 (43\%) who received aripiprazole and 26 (29\%) who  received placebo. Baseline set shifting moderated the efficacy of aripiprazole  augmentation (odds ratio [OR], 1.66 [95\% CI, 1.05-2.62]; P\,=\,.03 for interaction  with treatment). Among participants with a Trail Making Test scaled score of 7 or  higher, the odds of remission were significantly higher with aripiprazole than with  placebo (53\% vs 28\%; number needed to treat, 4; OR, 4.11 [95\% CI, 1.83-9.20]). Among  participants with a Trail Making Test scaled score of less than 7, aripiprazole and  placebo were equally efficacious (OR, 0.64 [95\% CI, 0.15-2.80]). Greater severity of  anxiety at baseline predicted a lower remission rate but did not moderate  aripiprazole efficacy; each standard deviation greater anxiety severity was  associated with 50\% reduced odds of remission in both aripiprazole and placebo arms.  Medical comorbidity and Color-Word Interference test performance were neither  general predictors nor treatment-moderating factors. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:  Set-shifting performance indicates which older adults with treatment-resistant  depression may respond favorably to augmentation with aripiprazole and thus may help  to personalize treatment.

Ibuprofen is chemically related to fenoprofen and naproxen, but lack of effect for any one in this chemical class of propionic-acid derivatives does not necessarily mean lack of effect for any other in an individual patient. The drug has analgesic properties, probably related to its anti-inflammatory effect. It inhibits prostaglandin synthesis and has no effect on the adrenopituitary axis, making it a nonsteroidal agent. Ibuprofen has been shown to be effective in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis and is probably effective in ankylosing spondylitis, gout, and Bartter's syndrome.},

  abstract = {"Rumors may be the oldest medium of mass communication of information or ideas. Even before there were newspapers, radio, or television, rumors communicated by word-of-mouth made and shattered reputations, and set off riots and wars. Yet contrary to predictions, rumors continue to thrive, in spite of and parallel to mass media. What accounts for the puzzling persistence and continuing significance of this little-studied social phenomenon? Jean-No;el Kapferer examines the theory and practice of rumors, focusing on specific areas such as entertainment, criminal behavior, business and finance, and politics. He describes the kinds of conditions that give birth to rumors, why we believe them, and the hidden messages they convey. Kapferer points out that rumors frequently serve useful social purposes and present rich examples. He speculates about how rumors can be controlled, changed, and prevented. Drawing upon contributions of disciplines ranging from psychology to history, and integrating the insights of Europeans with the latest work of American researchers, this is the most comprehensive examination of rumors, gossip, and urban legends yet published. Translated into nine languages, this edition was updated with advances in theory and research since the book's original French publication in 1987. Its brisk, accessible style makes the book of interest to psychologists, economists, political scientists, sociologists, and folklore analysts, as well as the general reader who is curious about the origins of this fascinating social phenomenon."--Provided by publisher.},

We aimed to detect connectivity differences across  a treatment trial among LLD patients as a function of remission status. LLD patients  (N=37) were enrolled into a 12-week trial of venlafaxine and underwent five  functional magnetic resonance imaging resting state scans during treatment. Patients  had no history of drug abuse, psychosis, dementia/neurodegenerative diseases or  medical conditions with known effects on mood. We investigated whether there were  differences in three networks: DMN, ECN and anterior salience network connectivity,  as well as a whole brain centrality measure (eigenvector centrality). We found that  remitters showed increases in ECN connectivity in the right precentral gyrus and  decreases in DMN connectivity in the right inferior frontal gyrus and supramarginal  gyrus. The ECN and DMN had regions (middle temporal gyrus and bilateral  middle/inferior temporal/fusiform gyrus, respectively) that showed reversed effects  (decreased ECN and increased DMN, respectively). Early changes in functional  connectivity can occur after initial medication exposure. This study offers new  data, indicating that functional connectivity changes differ depending on treatment  response and can occur shortly after exposure to antidepressant medication.},

  abstract = {Altered HPA-axis functioning is a hypothesized mechanism for worsened cognition in depression. The current study examines the indirect effects of depression on  processing speed, executive functioning, and memory as a function of the HPA-axis.  38 individuals with a depression diagnosis and 50 healthy controls (HCs) aged 18-86  underwent neuropsychological testing and at-home diurnal salivary cortisol  collection. Depression was assessed via structured clinical interviews and rating  scales. Cognitive composite scores were derived from factor analysis. Daytime  cortisol exposure was estimated using area under the curve (AUC). Depression was  associated with higher cortisol levels and slower processing speed . A significant  suppression effect of AUC was present on the relationship between depression and  processing speed. Limitations include the cross-sectional design and limited sample  heterogeneity. Though poorly modulated HPA-axis is one proposed mechanism of  cognitive alterations in depression, our results did not support this conclusion for  processing speed. Alternative mechanisms should be considered to inform  interventions to target cognitive alterations in depression.},

  abstract = {Late-life depression (LLD) is a growing worldwide problem due to demographic changes, with limited treatment options due to high rates of pharmacotherapy adverse  effects, accessibility of psychotherapy, and tolerability of electroconvulsive  therapy. Novel neuromodulation techniques, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic  stimulation (rTMS), may overcome these limitations. The objective of this study is  to determine the efficacy, tolerability, and cognitive effects of high-dose deep  rTMS in LLD. In this study we randomized older adults between 60 and 85 years old  with major depressive disorder (MDD) to sham or active deep rTMS (H1 coil, 6012  pulses, 18\,Hz, 120\% of resting motor threshold) delivered over the dorsolateral and  ventrolateral prefrontal cortex 5 days per week over 4 weeks. Our primary outcome  was remission of depression in an intention-to-treat analysis. We also assessed  change in cognitive functioning with rTMS treatment and tolerability based on  adverse effects. Fifty-two participants were randomized to active (n\,=\,25) or sham  H1 coil (n\,=\,27). Remission rate was significantly higher with active than sham rTMS  (40.0\% vs 14.8\%) with a number needed to treat of 4.0 (95\% CI: 2.1-56.5). There was  no change on any measure of executive function and no serious adverse events.  Adverse effect profiles were similar between active and sham rTMS, except for  reports of pain being significantly more common in the active condition (16.0\% vs  0\%). High-dose deep rTMS appears to be safe, well tolerated, and efficacious in the  treatment of LLD.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Geriatric depression is associated with frontolimbic functional deficits, and this frontal dysfunction may underlie the marked executive control  deficits often seen in this population. The authors' goal was to assess the  integrity of frontal cortical functioning in geriatric depression, while these  individuals performed a standard cognitive control task. The N2 component of the  event-related potential (ERP), an evoked response generated within the anterior  cingulate cortex (ACC), is significantly enhanced when nondepressed individuals  successfully inhibit a response, providing an excellent metric of frontal inhibitory  function. DESIGN: The authors used a variant of a demanding Go/NoGo task-switching  paradigm that required participants to inhibit response execution during NoGo trials  by overcoming a potent response tendency established by frequent Go trials.  PARTICIPANTS: The authors compared a cohort of depressed geriatric outpatients (N =  11) with a similarly aged group of nondepressed participants (N = 11). MEASUREMENTS:  Reaction times, accuracy, and high-density event-related potential recordings from a  64-channel electrode montage were obtained. RESULTS: A significantly enhanced N2 to  NoGo trials was observed in nondepressed elderly participants, with generators  localized to the ACC. In contrast, this enhancement was strongly reduced in the  depressed sample. Source analysis and topographic mapping pointed to a displacement  of N2 generators toward more posterior areas of the middle frontal gyrus in  depressed subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Findings confirm previous reports of an inhibitory  control deficit in depressed elderly who show significantly increased rates of  commission errors (i.e., failures to inhibit responses on NoGo trials).  Electrophysiologic data suggest underlying dysfunction in ACC as the basis for this  deficit.},

While existing studies have attended to Islam’s engagement with capitalism, less attention has been given to the ideological intimacy of this relationship and, in particular, the increasing presence of radical free market thought in global Islamist politics, or what I have termed ‘libertarian Islamism’. The dominant narrative of Islamism, thus, constricts our understanding of the wider ideological ecology at play in the global political mobilization of Islam. While political Islam is often regarded as being rooted in a broadly leftist intellectual milieu, it has rather encapsulated variant conceptions of liberty, both left and right, and is currently undergoing what one might term a ‘free-market turn’. Within this milieu, a distinctly radical, anti-statist libertarian ideology has also emerged with an intimate relationship to conservative libertarian activists in the West. The presence of libertarian Islamism serves to recalibrate dominant understandings of ‘radical’ Islam and its purportedly fractious ideological relationship with the West.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cognitive decline, which often occurs in heart failure, is likely to decrease health-related quality of life and increase morbidity and mortality (major  events), but it has been scantly addressed. AIMS: To examine whether baseline  cognitive domains of global cognition, memory and executive function predict  baseline health-related quality of life and 15-month major events among patients  with heart failure. METHODS: This prospective study included 117 patients (mean age  65.5 ± 9.42 years; men 58.1\%; New York Heart Association class III/IV 25.6\%), who  completed questionnaires, including neuropsychological testing for cognitive  evaluation, depressive symptoms, self-care and health-related quality of life  measures. Their 15-month major events were extracted from medical record reviews.  RESULTS: Approximately one-third of the sample had cognitive impairment. Forty-one  patients (35.0\%) experienced major events. Patients with major events had  significantly worse memory (immediate recall memory 13.9 vs. 11.5, P=0.030; delayed  recall memory 4.3 vs. 3.1, P=0.014) and reduced executive function (trail-making  test A 28.1 vs. 38.0 seconds, P=0.031). After controlling for age, sex, heart  failure severity and comorbidity, memory loss with depressive symptoms was  associated with worse health-related quality of life, and odds ratios of  experiencing major events increased only with reduced cognitive function in global  cognition and executive function. CONCLUSION: Cognitive function is an important  factor for health-related quality of life and major events, and memory loss -  worsened health-related quality of life and poor executive function was more likely  to increase the risk of major events. Future studies should consider both cognitive  function and depressive symptoms when designing heart failure interventions to  improve patient outcomes.},

SETTING: A cross-sectional community-based  study in South Korea. PARTICIPANTS: : A total of 2,007 participants age 65 or older.  MEASUREMENTS: Depression was diagnosed with DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical  Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition) criteria using a questionnaire based on  the Korean version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Executive  dysfunction was evaluated by the Initiation/Perseveration subscale of the Korean  version of the Dementia Rating Scale. Information about demography and vascular risk  factors was assessed using questionnaires. RESULTS: A total of 88 depressed elderly  participants were identified. Previous cerebrovascular attack was found to increase  the risk of DED syndrome, whereas hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and heart disease  did not. A trend (p = 0.024) emerged, although it did not reach significance,  suggesting an association between diabetes and DED. Depression without executive  dysfunction was not associated with any vascular risk factors. In participants who  reported two or more symptoms related to DSM-IV depression criteria (N = 335),  executive dysfunction was associated with psychomotor retardation, feelings of  worthlessness, and feelings of guilt. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the  concept of DED syndrome is useful for identifying geriatric depression patients with  a high risk of vascular risk factors. Attention to executive dysfunction in  depressive elderly patients may help clinicians identify patients who need early  intervention and careful follow-up for vascular risk factors.},

This pilot study examined the effects of AFC on ADHD symptoms and electroencephalography (EEG) in college students with and without ADHD. Methods: At baseline, control and ADHD participants completed the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS), simple and complex attention measures, and resting-state EEG recordings. ADHD participants (n = 18) and a subset of controls (extended control group or EC, n = 11) avoided AFC in their diet for 2 weeks and then were randomized to a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover challenge. Subjects received either 225 mg AFC disguised in chocolate cookies or placebo chocolate cookies for 3 days each week, with testing on the third day each week. Baseline comparisons were made using Student's t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum tests and challenge period analyses were run using General Linear Modeling. Results: The ADHD group had significantly greater scores on the ASRS (p {$<$} 0.001), confirming a symptom differential between groups; however, there were no differences in attentional measures or EEG at baseline. The AFC challenge resulted in an increase in posterior mean gamma power (p = 0.05), a decrease in posterior relative alpha power (p = 0.04), and a marginal increase in inattentive symptoms (p = 0.08) in the ADHD group. There were no effects of AFC in the EC group. Discussion: This study indicates that AFC exposure may affect brainwave activity and ADHD symptoms in college students with ADHD. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.},

These contributions come at a considerable cost: U.S. academic libraries paid \$1.7 billion for serial subscriptions in 2008 alone. Library budgets, in contrast, are flat and not able to keep pace with serial price inflation. We have investigated the publishers' value proposition by conducting a comparative study of pre-print papers and their final published counterparts. This comparison had two working assumptions: 1) if the publishers' argument is valid, the text of a pre-print paper should vary measurably from its corresponding final published version, and 2) by applying standard similarity measures, we should be able to detect and quantify such differences.

La crise sanitaire a toutefois montré avec éclat que nous n'avons guère retenu la leçon, révélant l'ambivalence de notre rapport à la science et le peu de crédit que nous accordons à la rationalité qu'il lui revient d'établir. Lorsque, d'un côté, l'inculture prend le pouvoir, que, de l'autre, l'argument d'autorité écrase tout sur son passage, lorsque la crédibilité de la recherche ploie sous la force de l'évènement et de l'opinion, comment garder le goût du vrai - celui de découvrir, d'apprendre, de comprendre ? Quand prendrons-nous enfin sereinement acte de nos connaissances, ne serait-ce que pour mieux vivre dans cette nature dont rien d'absolu ne nous sépare ?" -- [4e de couverture]},

  abstract = {The United Kingdom and European Union recently restricted the use of artificial food colorings (AFCs) to improve the health of children. These decisions provide an interesting case study of the role of scientific evidence in the assessment of food additives and risk to children's health and formulation of food policy. Although there continues to be uncertainty concerning the link between AFCs and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), policy decisions have been made that have far-reaching implications. In addition, publicity surrounding the policy changes may shape public perceptions concerning effective management of ADHD. We believe that the balance of existing evidence neither refutes nor supports the link between AFCs and ADHD, which highlights the need for carefully designed studies to further investigate the link between AFCs and ADHD. In this article we describe a model for such studies. In developing our model, we drew from current investigative standards in ADHD research, such as those used in the landmark Multimodal Treatment Study of Children With ADHD. These standards encompass methodologic considerations including sample selection, outcome assessment, and data analyses. It is our hope that this model research methodology may prove valuable in addressing design considerations in future studies of AFCs and ADHD with the goal of producing reliable data that will enable policy-makers to better formulate effective, evidence-based food-policy decisions.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Geriatric depression often presents with memory and cognitive complaints that are associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In a parent  clinical trial of escitalopram combined with memantine or placebo for geriatric  depression and subjective memory complaints, we found that memantine improved  executive function and delayed recall performance at 12 months (NCT01902004). In  this report, we used positron emission tomography (PET) to assess the relationship  between in-vivo amyloid and tau brain biomarkers and clinical and cognitive  treatment response. DESIGN: In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial,  we measured 2-(1-\{6-[(2-[F18]fluoroethyl)(methyl)amino]-2-naphthyl\}ethylidene)  malononitrile ([18F]FDDNP) binding at baseline and assessed mood and cognitive  performance at baseline, posttreatment (6 months), and naturalistic follow-up (12  months). PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-two older adults with major depressive disorder and  subjective memory complaints completed PET scans and were included in this report.  RESULTS: Across both treatment groups, higher frontal lobe [18F]FDDNP binding at  baseline was associated with improvement in executive function at 6 months  (corrected p = .045). This effect was no longer significant at 12 months (corrected  p = .12). There was no association of regional [18F]FDDNP binding with change in  mood symptoms (corrected p = .2). CONCLUSIONS: [18F]FDDNP binding may predict  cognitive response to antidepressant treatment. Larger trials are required to  further test the value of [18F]FDDNP binding as a biomarker for cognitive  improvement with antidepressant treatment in geriatric depression.},

  abstract = {Verbal memory deficits attributed to late life depression (LLD) may result from executive dysfunction that is more detrimental to list-learning than story-based  recall when compared to healthy aging. Despite these behavioral dissociations,  little work has been done investigating related neuroanatomical dissociations across  types of verbal memory performance in LLD. We compared list-learning to story-based  memory performance in 24 non-demented individuals with LLD (age \textasciitilde{} 66.1 ± 7.8) and 41  non-demented/non-depressed healthy controls (HC; age \textasciitilde{} 67.6 ± 5.3). We correlated  significant results of between-group analyses across memory performance variables  with brain volumes of frontal, temporal and parietal regions known to be involved  with verbal learning and memory. When compared to the HC group, the LLD group showed  significantly lower verbal memory performance for spontaneous recall after repeated  exposure and after a long-delay but only for the list-learning task; groups did not  differ on story-based memory performance. Despite equivalent brain volumes across  regions, only the LLD group showed brain associations with verbal memory performance  and only for the list-learning task. Specifically, frontal volumes important for  subjective organization and response monitoring correlated with list-learning  performance in the LLD group. This study is the first to demonstrate neuroanatomical  dissociations across types of verbal memory performance in individuals with LLD.  Results provide structural evidence for the behavioral dissociations between  list-learning and story-based recall in LLD when compared to healthy aging. More  specifically, it points toward a network of predominantly anterior brain regions  that may underlie the executive contribution to list-learning in older adults with  depression.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Clinical depression in the elderly is associated with cerebral small vessel disease. It is less certain whether the endorsement of depressive symptoms in  the absence of clinical depression, relatively common in euthymic older adults, is  also associated with white matter damage. The majority of studies exploring this  issue have produced mixed results, perhaps due, in part, to differences in defining  the threshold for depression, notating vascular risk factors, and/or the  neuroimaging tools used to quantify white matter damage. We aimed to address these  issues with non-demented euthymic older adults. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: We  performed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI) in a population based cohort of 79 individuals (mean age = 68 years).  MEASUREMENTS: In addition to neuroimaging, the authors report assessments of overall  cognition, executive functioning, and depression. RESULTS: Scores on the Geriatric  Depression Scale 15-item (GDS-15) correlated with DTI measures of mean diffusivity  (r [77] = 0.23, p = 0.039) and fractional anisotropy (r [77] = -0.22, p = 0.045) but  only approached significance for T2-weighted MRI measures of white matter  hyperintensities (WMH; r [77] = 0.21, p = 0.053). After adjusting for factors known  to influence the development of WMH and depression, including age and vascular  risks, DTI-derived indices of white matter integrity remained significantly  associated with GDS-15 scores. Furthermore, only DTI-derived measures of white  matter integrity contributed to the variance in GDS-15 scores in logistical  regression modeling. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate an association between  white matter damage and the endorsement of depressive symptoms in euthymic older  adults and suggest that DTI may be more sensitive to this damage than T2-WMH in an  aging cohort with multiple vascular risk factors.},

Il nous faut accepter la chute, que l'on s'en désespère ou que l'on y trouve une jouissance coupable. Autrement dit, "il n'y a pas d'alternative" - comme le disait en son temps Margaret Thatcher. Or il y a une alternative. Il y en a même de très nombreuses, car ailleurs la catastrophe est déjà arrivée et a déjà donné naissance à des mobilisations politiques et écologiques. Le catastrophisme, cette construction récente qui touche les classes moyennes occidentales, c'est un "récit du Tout ", un récit dépolitisé qui nous encourage à nous prendre en charge de manière privée. Or, c'est en politisant l'écologie et en adoptant un point de vue local que nous verrons se rouvrir les possibilités d'action, dans leur : pluralité.

  abstract = {Over the past half century, two overarching questions have dominated the study of mass political behavior: How do ordinary citizens form their political judgments, and how good are those judgments from a normative perspective? The authors of The Ambivalent Partisan offer a novel approach to these questions, one in which political reasoning is viewed as arising from trade-offs among three generally conflicting psychological goals: making decisions easily, getting them right, and maintaining cognitive consistency. Taking aim at decades of received wisdom, the central claim of this book is that high-quality political judgment hinges less on citizens' cognitive ability than on their willingness to temporarily suspend partisan habits and follow the "evidence" wherever it leads. This occurs most readily when citizens experience a disjuncture between their stable political identities and their contemporary evaluations of party performance, a state the authors refer to as partisan ambivalence. Drawing on both experimental and survey methods -- as well as five decades of American political history -- the authors demonstrate that compared to other citizens, ambivalent partisans perceive the political world accurately, form their policy preferences in a principled manner, and communicate those preferences by making issues an important component of their electoral decisions. The book's most important conclusion is that a non-trivial portion of the electorate manages to escape the vicissitudes of apathy or wanton bias, and it is these citizens -- these ambivalent partisans -- who reliably approximate a desirable standard of democratic citizenship.},

  abstract = {"En travail. Conversations sur le communisme" : c'est le titre du livre récemment publié par Bernard Friot et Frédéric Lordon aux éditions La Dispute, fruit d'échanges entre ces deux figures de la pensée de gauche organisés au printemps dernier par Amélie Jeammet.  Avec Julien Théry, qui les reçoit pour Le Média, les deux auteurs reviennent sur leurs points d'accord, qui portent sur l'essentiel : le communisme réel ne peut se développer ni en fuyant l'économie, les institutions et toute et la sphère de la production capitaliste dans des dissidences, ni en s'en remettant à un futur mythique et messianique. Bernard Friot s’intéresse à la poursuite de la construction d’institutions alternatives au capitalisme : salaire à vie, propriété d’usage, souveraineté sur l’investissement. Frédéric Lordon développe une philosophie spinoziste des institutions, après avoir, comme économiste, analysé le capitalisme financiarisé. Leurs trajectoires scientifiques et militantes sensiblement différentes n’en convergent pas moins sur la nécessité d’une proposition communiste qui donnerait à une mobilisation générale l’appui de figures et de réalisations concrètes. Il fallait une authentique rencontre intellectuelle, avec ce qu’elle suppose de confrontation fraternelle des idées, pour aboutir ainsi à cette mise en travail du communisme. ▶ Ni actionnaire, ni publicité, Le Média TV est indépendant et ne vit que de vos dons :  👉 https://www.lemediatv.fr/soutien ▶ Soutenez Le Média :  👉 https://www.lemediatv.fr/soutien 👉 https://www.okpal.com/le-media/ 👉 https://fr.tipeee.com/le-media ✅  Suivez-nous :  Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/lemedia\_tv/ Facebook : http://bit.ly/FacebookLeMedia Twitter : http://bit.ly/TwitterLeMedia Youtube : http://bit.ly/YouTubeLeMedia Peertube : https://video.lemediatv.fr Telegram :  https://t.me/LeMediaOfficiel Rejoignez la communauté des Socios !},

At times, it is used as a guide for organizing lessons, at other times it is used with the intention of summarizing essential curricular content. The way in which PowerPoint is used and the form it takes differs between faculties. The present article aims to evaluate the impact of the provision of slides on student academic performance and attendance (regardless of test scores). For this purpose, a quasi-experimental study was carried out with two intrasubject manipulated learning situations in which copies of slides created by teachers were, or were not, made available to students prior to class sessions. Additionally, student academic engagement and study strategies were assessed using two scales in order to analyse whether these variables modified the relationship between access to slides and academic performance. Outcomes revealed that access to slides developed by teachers had a negative impact on student performance and attendance to classes. Student academic engagement and study strategies were found to modify the relationship between academic performance and access to slides.},

However, the overlapping  and diverging amygdala network function abnormalities underlying two clinical LLD  phenotypes (i.e., LLD alone and LLD with mild cognitive impairment [LLD-MCI]) are  unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate the amygdala functional  connectivity (FC) differences between LLD alone, LLD-MCI and healthy controls, and  to examine the relationships between amygdala network dysfunction and symptom  dimensions. A resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging study  was conducted to probe amygdala FC in a total of 63 elderly participants (LLD  [n~=~22], LLD-MCI [n~=~15], and age- and gender-equated healthy older adults  [n~=~26]) using a seed-based voxelwise R-fcMRI approach. LLD-only adults showed  increased FC in the posterior default mode and vermis, and diminished connections in  the fronto-parietal, salience and temporal areas, relative to controls. The LLD-MCI  participants showed diminished FC in the default mode, cognitive control, salience  and visual regions, whereas increased FC was limited to lateral parietal cortex  compared with healthy controls. The LLD-MCI group also showed diminished FC in the  occipital and posterior default mode areas, relative to the LLD-only group. Distinct  amygdala FC abnormalities that explain depressive and anxiety symptom severity, and  executive functioning were identified. The amygdala FC impairments may distinguish  LLD phenotypes. These functional network abnormalities may also explain the  heterogeneity seen in the LLD clinical presentations.},

  abstract = {In order to improve appetite, attract consumers and even conform to the food culture, food coloring has become one of the necessary links in modern food processing. For example, dried-tofu will be colored by adding artificial food colors (AFCs) such as sunset yellow, cochineal red A or other seasonings like soy sauce. However, the dispute persists about whether AFCs are harmful to health. Some studies indicate AFCs affect children's intelligence and attention, cause hyperactivity, and allergy when children consumed {$>$}= 50 mg. In addition, researches showed that chemical soy sauce produces a trace of methylglyoxal (MGO) in the manufacturing process, which is related to diseases such as oxidative stress, diabetes, and cognitive deterioration. Therefore, natural pigments are relatively new and promising strategy for replacing high-risk AFCs. Thus, the objective of this study was to use dried-tofu as a natural colorants coloring screening platform, through the concept of three primary colors to discuss the coloring effects of natural colorants in Taiwan in double-phase (liquid phase to solid phase) food coloring system and assess the effects of MGO on PC12 neuron cellular morphology and cell cycle at the dietary exposure in soy sauce. Our results showed that formula G:R = 0.2:0.8 and C:R = 0.08:0.92 were coloring by combined natural colorants had the same eye sensory quality acceptance of consumer and had the intention to purchase. Furthermore, the results from the PC12 cell suggested that dietary exposure of methylglyoxal ({$<$}50 mu M) in soy sauce did not affect neuron cellular morphology and cell cycle significantly. Overall, Gardenia Yellow, Curcumin, and Radish Red could overcome the application restrictions in multiple-phase food coloring system and simultaneously soy sauce as a coloring agent was safety. It showed the possibility of them as food colorants on dried-tofu. (C) 2018 "Society information". Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Family history of major depressive disorder (MDD) increases individuals' vulnerability to depression and alters the way depression manifests itself. Emotion  processing and attention shifting are functions altered by MDD and family history of  the disease; therefore, it is important to recognize the neural correlates of these  functions in association with both factors. METHODS: Our study determines neural  correlates of emotion processing and attention shifting for healthy individuals and  patients with MDD with and without family history of depression. We compared the  performance and neural activity in a functional magnetic resonance imaging  experiment examining emotion processing and attention shifting in all participants.  RESULTS: Our sample included 4 study groups: healthy controls without family history  of depression (n = 25), patients with MDD without family history of the disease (n =  20), unaffected healthy first-degree relatives of patients with MDD (n = 21) and  patients with MDD with family history of MDD (n = 30). Compared with healthy  controls, unaffected first-degree relatives overactivate the somatosensory cortex  and the attention controlling areas during both emotion processing and attention  shifting. Patients with family history of MDD have stronger neural activation in  subcortical areas during shifting attention from negative stimuli. Patients without  family history of MDD have less activation in the paralimbic regions and more  activation in core limbic areas, especially during emotion processing. LIMITATIONS:  The conclusions about the intergroup differences in activation can be drawn only  about neural areas engaged in the task. CONCLUSION: Unaffected first-degree  relatives of patients with MDD overreact to external emotional cues and compensate  for the vulnerability with increased involvement of executive control. Patients with  a family history of MDD have less executive control over their attentional shifts in  the face of negative stimuli. Patients without a family history of MDD process  emotional stimuli in a more visceral way than controls.},

  abstract = {Executive dysfunction is a common and disabling component of late-life depression (LLD), yet its neural mechanisms remain unclear. In particular, it is not yet known  how executive functioning in LLD relates to measures of cortical physiology that may  change with age and illness, namely cortical inhibition/excitation and plasticity.  Here, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to measure cortical  inhibition/excitation (n\,=\,51), and the potentiation of cortical activity following  paired associative stimulation, which is thought to reflect long-term potentiation  (LTP)-like cortical plasticity (n\,=\,32). We assessed the correlation between these  measures of cortical physiology and two measures of executive functioning: cognitive  inhibition, assessed using the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System Color-Word  Interference ["Stroop"] Test, and cognitive flexibility, assessed using the Trail  Making Test. Correlations with recall memory and processing speed were also  performed to assess the specificity of any associations to executive functioning. A  significant correlation was found between greater LTP-like cortical plasticity and  poorer cognitive inhibition, a core executive function (r(p)\,=\,-0.56, p\,{$<$}\,0.001). We  did not observe significant associations between cortical inhibition/excitation and  executive functioning, or between any neurophysiological measure and cognitive  flexibility, memory, or processing speed. Our finding that elevated cortical  plasticity is associated with diminished cognitive inhibition emphasizes the  importance of balanced synaptic strengthening to healthy cognition. More  specifically, our findings suggest that hyper-excitability of cortical circuits  following repeated cortical activation may promote inappropriate prepotent responses  in LLD. LTP-like cortical plasticity might therefore represent a neural mechanism  underlying an inhibitory control cognitive endophenotype of LLD.},

  abstract = {Cognitive biases are systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment, and are often studied in psychology and behavioral economics. Although the reality of most of these biases is confirmed by reproducible research, there are often controversies about how to classify these biases or how to explain them. Some are effects of information-processing rules (i.e., mental shortcuts), called heuristics, that the brain uses to produce decisions or judgments. Biases have a variety of forms and appear as cognitive ("cold") bias, such as mental noise, or motivational ("hot") bias, such as when beliefs are distorted by wishful thinking. Both effects can be present at the same time.There are also controversies over some of these biases as to whether they count as useless or irrational, or whether they result in useful attitudes or behavior. For example, when getting to know others, people tend to ask leading questions which seem biased towards confirming their assumptions about the person. However, this kind of confirmation bias has also been argued to be an example of social skill: a way to establish a connection with the other person.Although this research overwhelmingly involves human subjects, some findings that demonstrate bias have been found in non-human animals as well. For example, loss aversion has been shown in monkeys and hyperbolic discounting has been observed in rats, pigeons, and monkeys.},

METHODS: A total  of 33 inpatients diagnosed as depression disorder according to ICD-10 completed the  Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult Version (BRIEF-A) and Hamilton  Depression Scale (HAMD) before and after a 6-week antidepressant treatment. RESULTS:  (1) After treatment, they yielded lower scores significantly on most subscales of  BRIEF-A (t = 2.061 - 4.229, P {$<$} 0.05), including total score [(127 ± 27) vs (113 ±  28)], shifting [(11.7 ± 2.7) vs (10.3 ± 2.6)], emotion control [(18.8 ± 4.6) vs  (15.8 ± 4.4)], monitoring [(9.6 ± 3.0) vs (8.8 ± 2.7)], initiation [(15.6 ± 3.7) vs  (13.2 ± 3.6)], working memory [(14.9 ± 3.4) vs (13.3 ± 3.9)], planning [(18.3 ± 4.4)  vs (16.6 ± 4.4)], organization [(12.4 ± 3.8) vs (11.4 ± 3.1)], behavioral regulation  index (BRI), metacognition index (MI) and global executive composite (GEC). (2)  Before treatment, Person's correlation test showed that the total score of HAMD and  all subscales of BRIEF-A had no significant correlation respectively (r = -0.145 -  0.220, P {$>$} 0.05). (3) After treatment, the deduction of total score of HAMD and the  deduction of the scores of inhibiting belonging to behavioral regulation index (BRI)  and initiation, planning belonging to metacognition index (MI) had moderate  correlations respectively(r = 0.450, 0.432, 0.403, P {$<$} 0.05). (4) Multiple  regression analysis showed that the scores of working memory, organization and the  deduction of total score of HAMD had significantly negative correlations  respectively (t = -2.295, -2.488, P {$<$} 0.05). CONCLUSION: The antidepressant  treatment can improve ecological executive function of depression patients. And the  improvements of ecological executive function and depression symptoms are partially  correlated.},

  abstract = {The communication and regulation of risk has changed significantly over the past 30 years in Europe and to a noticeable but lesser extent in the United States. In Europe, this is partly due to a series of regulatory mishaps, ranging from mad cow disease in the United Kingdom to contamination of the blood supply in France. In the United States, general public confidence in the American government has been gradually declining for more than three decades, driven by a mix of cultural and political conflicts like negative political advertising, a corrosive news media, and cuts in regulatory budgets. While the former approach is based on an objective assessment of the risk, the latter is driven more by the perception of the risk, consumer sentiment, political will, and sectoral advocacy. In this article, the author examines three U.S.-based food case studies (acrylamide, bisphenol A, and artificial food colorings) where regulations at the local and state levels are increasingly being based on perceived risk advocacy rather than on the most effective response to the risk, be it to food safety or public health, as defined by regulatory interpretation of existing data. In the final section, the author puts forward a series of recommendations for how U.S.-based regulators can best handle those situations where the perceived risk is markedly different from the fact-based risk, such as strengthening the communication departments of food regulatory agencies, training officials in risk communication, and working more proactively with neutral third-party experts.},

Method: One hundred thirty children (70 boys and 60 girls) in Hong Kong with a mean age of 8.64 years were enlisted to the study with a within-subject crossover between AFCs, a preservative (sodium benzoate), and a placebo capsule. Two behavior scores were used including the strengths and weaknesses of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and normal behavior rating scale and the child behavior checklist-teacher report form. Results: Capsule A containing AFCs and Capsule B containing sodium benzoate had no significant adverse effect compared with placebo in both behavior scores. This result persisted when analysis was restricted to children with 85\% consumption of capsule (per protocol analysis). Conclusion: There seem to be no significant associations between AFCs and a preservative on Chinese children's behavior at the age of 8 to 9 years.

Cette fois c’est la planète elle-même qui nous somme. Ou plutôt la planète telle que nous nous la rendons à nous-mêmes inhabitables. Sur ce front-là, on ne tergiverse pas, on ne négocie pas, on n’atermoie pas. Le changement climatique est en marche et, pour la première fois, la Covid-19 nous a fait apercevoir que nous n’aurions pas seulement à en souffrir les canicules, les épisodes météorologiques extrêmes ou les pieds dans l’eau, mais également la libération de virus dont celui qui nous met presque à genoux en ce moment est sans doute l’un des plus «~bénins~».~Posée l’urgence de la situation, c’est l’urgence de penser la situation qui est posée avec elle. Mais peut-être «~penser~» n’est-il pas le mot le plus approprié quand il s’agit de donner le plus de chances à la bonne branche de la bifurcation. «~Imaginer~» pourrait être meilleur. Car la politique, dès lors qu’elle n’a pas pour seule ambition de reconduire l’ordre des choses à l’identique, au moment même où elle fait face à l’obligation impérieuse de faire advenir du radicalement différent, la politique, donc, est affaire d’imagination, au sens littéral du mot~: d’offrir des images. Ou des figures. Aller vers un avenir suppose de s’en être donné des figures.~C’est ce que ce livre s’essaye à faire, à partir d’une position de principes fondamentaux, dont le premier énonce qu’une société communiste a pour devoir de relever les individus de la précarité, de les libérer de l’angoisse des lendemains dans laquelle le marché capitaliste, qui détient toutes les données de leur reproduction matérielle, les plonge inévitablement – et l’effrayante crise sociale qui s’annonce à la suite de la crise sanitaire se chargera d’en donner l’illustration. L’instrument de cette libération s’appelle «~la garantie économique générale~». Elle est directement inspirée des travaux de Bernard Friot sur le «~salaire à vie~». Et se pose très explicitement la question d’un nouveau mode de production, c’est- à-dire des nouveaux rapports sociaux propres à soutenir une division du travail développée en ses multiples échelles~: du local au global.~Sous cette condition, tous les rapports sociaux peuvent être repensés – et en l’occurrence les rapports du capitalisme abolis~: rapport salarial, rapports de propriété privée des moyens de production, rapports financiers. C’est ici qu’aident les figures : à donner des images de ces perspectives constamment renvoyées au registre de «~l’utopie~». Là où les figurations progressent, les disqualifications par l’utopie s’effacent.~Mais ça n’est pas tout d’avoir des figures~: il faut aussi imaginer les trajectoires politiques qui permettent de les rejoindre. Au moins en poser les données fondamentale~: le type de résistance que la bourgeoisie opposera à la disparition de son monde, le type de dynamique politique que cette résistance appellera, le type de bloc social à constituer pour prévaloir, notamment les alliances à passer entre luttes anticapitalistes et luttes antiracistes, enfin la manière dont se redéploie la question internationaliste.},

The novelty and rapid spread of the virus have added a new urgency to the availability and distribution of reliable information to help curb its fatal potential. As seasoned and trusted purveyors of reliable public information, librarians have attempted to respond to the “infodemic” of fake news, disinformation, and propaganda with a variety of strategies, but the COVID-19 pandemic presents a unique challenge because of the deadly stakes involved. The seriousness of the current situation requires that librarians and associated professionals re-evaluate the ethical basis of their approach to information provision to counter the growing prominence of conspiracy theories in the public sphere and official decision making. This paper analyzes the conspiracy mindset and specific COVID-19 conspiracy theories in discussing how libraries might address the problems of truth and untruth in ethically sound ways. As a contribution to the re-evaluation we propose, the paper presents an ethical framework based on alethic rights—or rights to truth—as conceived by Italian philosopher Franca D’Agostini and how these might inform professional approaches that support personal safety, open knowledge, and social justice.},

  abstract = {Background One of people’s major motives for going online is the search for health-related information. Most consumers start their search with a general search engine but are unaware of the fact that its sorting and ranking criteria do not mirror information quality. This misconception can lead to distorted search outcomes, especially when the information processing is characterized by heuristic principles and resulting cognitive biases instead of a systematic elaboration. As vaccination opponents are vocal on the Web, the chance of encountering their non‒evidence-based views on immunization is high. Therefore, biased information processing in this context can cause subsequent impaired judgment and decision making. A technological debiasing strategy could counter this by changing people’s search environment. Objective This study aims at testing a technological debiasing strategy to reduce the negative effects of biased information processing when using a general search engine on people’s vaccination-related knowledge and attitudes. This strategy is to manipulate the content of Google’s knowledge graph box, which is integrated in the search interface and provides basic information about the search topic. Methods A full 3x2 factorial, posttest-only design was employed with availability of basic factual information (comprehensible vs hardly comprehensible vs not present) as the first factor and a warning message as the second factor of experimental manipulation. Outcome variables were the evaluation of the knowledge graph box, vaccination-related knowledge, as well as beliefs and attitudes toward vaccination, as represented by three latent variables emerged from an exploratory factor analysis. Results Two-way analysis of variance revealed a significant main effect of availability of basic information in the knowledge graph box on participants’ vaccination knowledge scores (F2,273=4.86, P=.01), skepticism/fear of vaccination side effects (F2,273=3.5, P=.03), and perceived information quality (F2,273=3.73, P=.02). More specifically, respondents receiving comprehensible information appeared to be more knowledgeable, less skeptical of vaccination, and more critical of information quality compared to participants exposed to hardly comprehensible information. Although, there was no significant interaction effect between the availability of information and the presence of the warning, there was a dominant pattern in which the presence of the warning appeared to have a positive influence on the group receiving comprehensible information while the opposite was true for the groups exposed to hardly comprehensible information and no information at all. Participants evaluated the knowledge graph box as moderately to highly useful, with no significant differences among the experimental groups. Conclusion Overall, the results suggest that comprehensible information in the knowledge graph box positively affects participants’ vaccination-related knowledge and attitudes. A small change in the content retrieval procedure currently used by Google could already make a valuable difference in the pursuit of an unbiased online information search. Further research is needed to gain insights into the knowledge graph box’s entire potential.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: depression is associated with worse executive function, but underlying mechanisms might differ by age. AIMS: to investigate whether vascular disease burden  affects the association between depression and executive dysfunction differentially  by age. METHOD: among 83,613 participants of Lifelines (population-based cohort  study), linear regression analyses were applied to examine the association between  executive function (Ruff Figural Fluency test, dependent variable) and depression  according to DSM-IV criteria (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview,  independent variable). RESULTS: adjusted for demographic characteristics, major  depressive disorder was associated with a lower level of executive function in both  younger and older adults. Minor depressive disorder was only associated with worse  executive function in younger adults. Adding vascular disease burden to the final  model with major depressive disorder, reduced this strength of this association by  5.9\% in younger and 5.0\% in older adults. CONCLUSIONS: major depression was  associated with worse executive function across the lifespan, but minor depression  only in younger adults. The impact of vascular burden on the association did not  differ between younger and older adults. Therefore, vascular risk reduction is  important in both age groups.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effects of therapeutic relationship (TR) in elder mental health are understudied. A greater understanding of TR in geriatric psychotherapy is  particularly needed for treating late-life depression with executive dysfunction,  which predicts poor response to antidepressant medication and presents unique  clinical challenges. METHODS: Participants were older patients (N = 220) with major  depression and executive dysfunction who received 12 weeks of problem-solving  therapy or supportive therapy in a randomized control trial. Multilevel growth curve  modeling and latent change scores were used to analyze TR dimensions of  Understanding and Accepting at the patient level (individual patient ratings, N =  194) and therapist level (ratings of each therapist averaged across participants, N  = 10). RESULTS: TR predicted reduction of depression in both treatment groups, while  treatment×TR interactions were not significant. Patients treated by therapists with  higher average Understanding (patient and therapist level) and Accepting (therapist  level) ratings had greater decreases in depression. The patient level×therapist  level interaction for Understanding approached statistical significance (p=.065),  suggesting a synergistic effect on treatment outcome. Together, Understanding and  Accepting predicted 21\% of variance in depression level changes. LIMITATIONS: TR was  not assessed throughout the course of treatment (only after the first therapy  session and at post-treatment) and did not include ratings from an objective  evaluator. CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of patient's experience of the TR and of  therapist ability to foster Understanding and Accepting can play a significant role  in the delivery of geriatric psychosocial interventions.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare patterns of cognitive performance in older adults with late-onset depression (LOD;~≥65 years of age) with that of older adults with  early-onset depression (EOD;~{$<$}65 years). METHODS: Participants were 171 adults aged  60 years or older with major depression and executive dysfunction who were  participating in a randomized psychotherapy trial. Participants included 72 LOD and  99 EOD individuals. Cognitive performance on measures of verbal learning, memory,  and executive functioning were evaluated. Demographic and clinical characteristics,  severity of cerebrovascular risk factors, and disability ratings were also compared  between groups. RESULTS: The LOD group was older and had fewer previous episodes of  depression and lower severity of depression compared with EOD participants. The LOD  group demonstrated poorer performance on measures of verbal learning (F(1,161)~=  4.28, p~= 0.04) and memory (F(1,160)~= 4.65, p~= 0.03) than the EOD group. Linear  regression analysis demonstrated that LOD and fewer years of education were  significant predictors of poorer verbal learning (F(7,114)~= 6.25, p~{$<$}0.001) and  memory (F(7,113)=7.24, p~{$<$}0.001). Performance on measures of executive functioning,  severity of vascular risk factors, and disability ratings did not differ between the  two groups. CONCLUSION: In older adults with depression and executive dysfunction,  LOD was associated with poorer performance on measures of verbal learning and  memory. Aging-related brain changes associated with LOD may play a more important  role, leading to dysfunction in these cognitive domains than a history of recurrent  depressive episodes in older adults with a dysexecutive syndrome.},

METHODS: Two hundred twenty-one adults aged 60 years and older  participated in a randomized clinical trial comparing the efficacy of Problem  Solving Therapy (PST) and Supportive Therapy (ST) for LLD. Cognitive performance on  seven tests of executive functioning, verbal learning, and memory was evaluated at  baseline, after 12 weeks of treatment, and at 24 weeks after the completion of  treatment. RESULTS: Performance on a measure of executive functioning with a  significant information processing speed component (Stroop Color and Word Test)  improved after treatment, F (1, 312)~= 8.50, p~= 0.002, and improved performance was  associated with a reduction in depressive symptoms but not treatment type.  Performance on other measures of executive functioning, verbal learning, and memory  did not change significantly after 12 weeks of psychotherapy treatment. CONCLUSION:  Our results suggest that improvements in cognitive functioning after psychotherapy  treatment for depression in older adults with executive dysfunction are likely focal  and not distributed across all cognitive domains. Although previous analyses  reported that PST was superior to ST in the treatment of depression, this analysis  indicated no difference between the two treatments with regard to improvements in  cognitive functioning.},

A cross-sectional study was conducted on representative samples of 387 married people from different places in Jazan region of Saudi Arabia from August to December 2019. The study utilized a validated questionnaire consisting of 12 questions to gather the information from 387 participants (52.9\% males and 47.03\% females). Approximately 77\% were young adults; belong to age group of 26-45 years (P = 0.000). Majority (40.5\%) of them had four or more children (P = 0.000). While significant level of knowledge about the use of foods and beverages containing coloring agent was found in the participants (P = 0.001), they were not aware that it may affect the child's health. Only 24.7\% were able to tell the name of a coloring agent (P = 0.001). Significant percentage (88.9\%) of parents reported about child hyperactivity after consumption of specific type of food and beverages, particularly fizzy drinks (35.61\%), chocolates (31.82\%), and sweets and candy (30.3\%). Target populations were considered to be aware of presence of coloring agent in food and beverages used by their children regularly but they are not much aware of its harmful effect on long-term use.},

Le concept d'Anthropocène, s'il a le mérite de nommer le problème, peine à identifier les coupables et s'empêtre dans le récit millénaire d'une humanité pyromane. Or si l'on veut comprendre le réchauffement climatique, ce ne sont pas les archives de "l'espèce humaine" qu'il faut sonder mais celles de l'Empire britannique, pour commencer. On y apprend par exemple que dans les années 1830 la vapeur était, aux mains des capitalistes anglais, un outil redoutable pour discipliner la force de travail et une arme de guerre impérialiste ; on y suit la progression fulgurante de la machine mise au point par James Watt qui supplante en quelques années la force hydraulique - pourtant abondante et moins chère - dans l'industrie textile anglaise. En puisant dans les sources de l'histoire sociale, ce livre raconte l'avènement du "capital fossile", ou comment la combustion ininterrompue de charbon a permis de repousser les limites de l'exploitation et du profit. Il faut couper la mèche qui brûle avant que l'étincelle n'atteigne la dynamite, écrivait Walter Benjamin dans un fragment célèbre, "Avertisseur d'incendie", où il insistait sur la nécessité d'en finir avec le capitalisme avant qu'il ne s'autodétruise et emporte tout avec lui. Pour Andreas Malm, on ne peut mieux dire l'urgence contemporaine de défaire l'économie fossile par des mesures révolutionnaires."},

Executive dysfunction can be assessed with cognitive tests and  subjective report of difficulties with executive skills. The present study  investigated the association between subjective report of executive functioning  complaints and time to escitalopram treatment response in older adults with major  depressive disorder (MDD). METHODS: 100 older adults with MDD (58 with executive  functioning complaints and 42 without executive functioning complaints) completed a  12-week trial of escitalopram. Treatment response over 12 weeks, as measured by  repeated Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores, was compared for adults with and  without executive complaints using mixed-effects modeling. RESULTS: Mixed effects  analysis revealed a significant group × time interaction, F(1, 523.34) = 6.00, p =  0.01. Depressed older adults who reported executive functioning complaints at  baseline demonstrated a slower response to escitalopram treatment than those without  executive functioning complaints. CONCLUSION: Self-report of executive functioning  difficulties may be a useful prognostic indicator for subsequent speed of response  to antidepressant medication.},

Although the effects of LLD make it important to achieve a diagnosis and  start treatment quickly, individuals with LLD are often inadequately or  unsuccessfully treated. The latest treatment developments suggest that interventions  targeting executive dysfunction and neuroticism, constructs associated with poor  response to antidepressants in older adults, are successful in treating LLD.  Specific behavioral interventions (computerized cognitive training, mindfulness  meditation, aerobic exercise) appear to decrease depressive symptoms and ameliorate  executive dysfunction and neuroticism, but we do not fully understand the mechanisms  by which these treatments work. We review recent research on neural network changes  underlying executive dysfunction and neuroticism in LLD and their association with  clinical outcomes (e.g., treatment response, cognitive functioning).},

In response, this paper investigates 3,073,351 citations found by these six data sources to 2,515 English-language highly-cited documents published in 2006 from 252 subject categories, expanding and updating the largest previous study. Google Scholar found 88\% of all citations, many of which were not found by the other sources, and nearly all citations found by the remaining sources (89–94\%). A similar pattern held within most subject categories. Microsoft Academic is the second largest overall (60\% of all citations), including 82\% of Scopus citations and 86\% of WoS citations. In most categories, Microsoft Academic found more citations than Scopus and WoS (182 and 223 subject categories, respectively), but had coverage gaps in some areas, such as Physics and some Humanities categories. After Scopus, Dimensions is fourth largest (54\% of all citations), including 84\% of Scopus citations and 88\% of WoS citations. It found more citations than Scopus in 36 categories, more than WoS in 185, and displays some coverage gaps, especially in the Humanities. Following WoS, COCI is the smallest, with 28\% of all citations. Google Scholar is still the most comprehensive source. In many subject categories Microsoft Academic and Dimensions are good alternatives to Scopus and WoS in terms of coverage.},

However, there remains substantial heterogeneity between  patients and inconsistent findings regarding the magnitude and prevalence of  specific neurocognitive deficits. This study aimed to investigate the potential for  different neurocognitive subgroups in patients diagnosed with MDD. METHOD: Data were  pooled from 4 different clinical trials that involved adults diagnosed with MDD.  Neurocognitive outcomes included measures of verbal learning and memory, executive  function, attention, and processing speed. Latent class analysis was conducted to  examine for different subgroups based on neurocognitive profiles of performance  across outcome measures. Subgroups were compared to a separate sample of age-matched  adult healthy controls, across illness factors, and individual mood items on the  Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). RESULTS: Within the MDD cohort (N  = 149), 45\% of participants were considered relatively "cognitively preserved," with  the remainder "cognitively reduced" (39\%) or "cognitively impaired" (16\%). Verbal  memory performance was significantly poorer compared to attention and processing  speed only in the "cognitively impaired" subgroup. There was no association between  subgroup membership and relevant illness factors, including ratings on individual  MADRS items. LIMITATIONS: Data were pooled from several studies that included  different neurocognitive measures and cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately half of  MDD participants had no or minimal objective cognitive difficulties, and  neurocognitive functioning was found generally unrelated to illness factors. Future  longitudinal research is warranted to determine whether the people who are  relatively cognitively impaired are at increased risk for further cognitive decline.

Subgroups were compared to a separate sample of age-matched  adult healthy controls, across illness factors, and individual mood items on the  Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). RESULTS: Within the MDD cohort (N  = 149), 45\% of participants were considered relatively "cognitively preserved," with  the remainder "cognitively reduced" (39\%) or "cognitively impaired" (16\%). Verbal  memory performance was significantly poorer compared to attention and processing  speed only in the "cognitively impaired" subgroup. There was no association between  subgroup membership and relevant illness factors, including ratings on individual  MADRS items. LIMITATIONS: Data were pooled from several studies that included  different neurocognitive measures and cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately half of  MDD participants had no or minimal objective cognitive difficulties, and  neurocognitive functioning was found generally unrelated to illness factors. Future  longitudinal research is warranted to determine whether the people who are  relatively cognitively impaired are at increased risk for further cognitive decline.

  abstract = {Objective: We evaluated processing-speed and shift-cost measures in adults with depression or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and monitored the effects of treatment. We hypothesised that cognitive-speed and shift-cost measures might differentiate diagnostic groups. Methods: Colour, form, and colour-form stimuli were used to measure naming times. The shift costs were calculated as colour-form-naming time minus the sum of colour- and form-naming times. Measurements were done at baseline and end point for 42 adults with depression and 42 with ADHD without depression. Patients with depression were treated with transcranial pulsed electromagnetic fields and patients with ADHD with methylphenidate immediate release. Results: During depression treatment, reductions in naming times were recorded weekly. One-way analysis of variance indicated statistical between-group differences, with effect sizes in the medium range for form and colour-form. In both groups, naming times were longer before than after treatment. For the ADHD group, shift costs exceeded the average-normal range at baseline but were in the average-normal range after stabilisation with stimulant medication. For the depression group, shift costs were in the average-normal range at baseline and after treatment. Baseline colour-form-naming times predicted reductions in naming times for both groups, with the largest effect size and index of forecasting efficiency for the ADHD group. Conclusions: The cognitive-processing-speed (colour-form) and shift-cost measures before treatment proved most sensitive in differentiating patients with depression and ADHD. Reductions in naming times for the depression group were suggested to reflect improved psychomotor skills rather than improved cognitive control.},

  abstract = {Food additives have been used throughout history to perform specific functions in foods. A comprehensive framework of legislation is in place within Europe to control the use of additives in the food supply and ensure they pose no risk to human health. Further to this, exposure assessments are regularly carried out to monitor population intakes and verify that intakes are not above acceptable levels (acceptable daily intakes). Young children may have a higher dietary exposure to chemicals than adults due to a combination of rapid growth rates and distinct food intake patterns. For this reason, exposure assessments are particularly important in this age group. The paper will review the use of additives and exposure assessment methods and examine factors that affect dietary exposure by young children. One of the most widely investigated unfavourable health effects associated with food additive intake in preschool-aged children are suggested adverse behavioural effects. Research that has examined this relationship has reported a variety of responses, with many noting an increase in hyperactivity as reported by parents but not when assessed using objective examiners. This review has examined the experimental approaches used in such studies and suggests that efforts are needed to standardise objective methods of measuring behaviour in preschool children. Further to this, a more holistic approach to examining food additive intakes by preschool children is advisable, where overall exposure is considered rather than focusing solely on behavioural effects and possibly examining intakes of food additives other than food colours.},

  abstract = {Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic has placed online learning, blended or hybrid provision as the "new normal" in Higher Education. For most universities and their academic libraries, especially those with a less strong online presence, the pandemic has caused numerous challenges. However, it has also been a catalyst for change and resifting of priorities. For academic librarians involved in the delivery of information skills/literacy training, a renewed mission is emerging, addressing access and connectivity to resources, designing for online education and fostering the development of digital literacy of students. Design/methodology/approach This is a conceptual paper based on the author's personal experiences and subjective opinion as a Library and Information Science educator with considerable expertise in online distance learning in the UK. Reflecting critically on the impact of the pandemic from an educational point of view and on key changes experienced, the paper centres on the argument that academic librarians could emerge as strategic partners in Higher Education, towards the direction of enhancing students' digital competences development. Findings The complete and involuntary shift to online learning due to COVID-19 restrictions has opened the door to multiple challenges in Higher Education, which are complex and ongoing: the implementation of remote tools and practices en masse in online teaching and learning in a way that ensures accessibility and equity for all, issues connecting to online pedagogy and how to prepare students with the information and digital literacy competences required for the new online learning "normal". As academic libraries move forward, they have a renewed mission to help learners in the online space to become both information rich and digitally competent. There is an opportunity to act as the connecting link that will help to move a step forward a strategic vision that places design for equity at the centre of education. Originality/value The impact of COVID-19 within Higher Education and academic libraries more specifically, is a theme that has not been yet sufficiently discussed, researched or critically debated as the world is still currently going through the pandemic crisis. This paper aims to initiate some early thoughts and conversation, as well as put forward the author's personal critical positioning on the issues, challenges and potential opportunities, emerging in the current educational climate for academic librarians, and to highlight areas of importance for the design and direction of information and library science curricula.},

Artificial food colorants have been suggested to affect children's behavior, being hyperactivity the most common disorder. In this study we compare binding affinities of a group of artificial colorants (sunset yellow, quinoline yellow, carmoisine, allura red and tartrazine) and their natural industrial equivalents (carminic acid, curcumin, peonidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-glucoside) to human serum albumin (HSA) by a docking approach and further refinement through atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Due to the protein-ligand conformational interface complexity, we used collective variable driven molecular dynamics to refine docking predictions and to score them according to a hydrogen-bond criterion. With this protocol, we were able to rank ligand affinities to HSA and to compare between the studied natural and artificial food additives. Our results show that the five artificial colorants studied bind better to HSA than their equivalent natural options, in terms of their H-bonding network, supporting the hypothesis of their potential risk to human health.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Suicidal behaviour aggregates in families, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and noradrenergic dysregulation may play a  role in suicide risk. It is unclear whether stress dysregulation is a heritable  trait of suicide or how it might increase risk. We investigated stress reactivity of  the autonomic nervous system and the HPA axis in suicide predisposition and  characterized the effect of this dysregulation on neuropsychologic function.  METHODS: In this family-based study of first-degree relatives (n = 14) of suicide  completers and matched controls with no family or personal history of suicidal  behaviour (n = 14), participants underwent the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). We  used salivary α-amylase and cortisol levels to characterize stress reactivity and  diurnal variation. We administered a series of neuropsychologic and executive  function tests before and after the TSST. RESULTS: Despite normal diurnal variation,  relatives of suicide completers exhibited blunted cortisol and α-amylase TSST  reactivity. Although there were no baseline differences in conceptual reasoning,  sustained attention or executive function, the relatives of suicide completers did  not improve on measures of inhibition upon repeated testing after TSST. Secondary  analyses suggested that these effects were related to suicide vulnerability  independent of major depression. LIMITATIONS: The sample size was small, and the  design prevents us from disentangling our findings from the possible traumatic  consequences of losing a relative by suicide. CONCLUSIONS: Blunted stress response  may be a trait of suicide risk, and impairment of stress-induced executive function  may contribute to suicide vulnerability.},

In this paper, we report the results of two deception studies whose goal was to better understand the critical relationship between Wikipedia and Google. These studies silently removed Wikipedia content from Google search results and examined the effect of doing so on participants’ interactions with both websites. Our findings demonstrate and characterize an extensive interdependence between Wikipedia and Google. Google becomes a worse search engine for many queries when it cannot surface Wikipedia content (e.g. click-through rates on results pages drop significantly) and the importance of Wikipedia content is likely greater than many improvements to search algorithms. Our results also highlight Google’s critical role in providing readership to Wikipedia. However, we also found evidence that this mutually beneficial relationship is in jeopardy: changes Google has made to its search results that involve directly surfacing Wikipedia content are significantly reducing traffic to Wikipedia. Overall, our findings argue that researchers and practitioners should give deeper consideration to the interdependence between peer production communities and the information technologies that use and surface their content.},

METHODS: A total of 257 consecutive acute ischemic stroke patients were included in  the study and followed up to 12 years. Depression was diagnosed 3 months after  stroke in 99 patients (38.5\%). FINDINGS: In Kaplan-Meier analysis, there was no  difference in survival of patients with and without poststroke depression (8.7  versus 8.3 years). Instead, patients with both depression and executive dysfunction  had shorter median survival than patients with neither depression nor executive  dysfunction (6.6 versus 10.3 years). Comparison between all patients with executive  dysfunction and patients without it, not regarding depressive status, showed that  executive dysfunction in itself was strongly associated with poor poststroke  survival (6.4 versus 10.6 years). In stepwise Cox regression proportional hazards  analysis adjusted with covariates, poststroke depression with executive dysfunction  (hazard ratio [HR] 1.63) and advanced age (HR 1.11) remained as independent  predictors of poor long-term survival. INTERPRETATION: The authors' well-defined  poststroke cohort with long-term follow-up indicates that in poststroke depression,  the depression-executive dysfunction syndrome is the predictor of poor long-term  survival rather than depression in itself.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The authors aim to investigate the association between white matter integrity and accelerated brain aging in late-life depression. METHODS: The authors  measured senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) index proteins, cognitive  performance, and MRI diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures of fractional  anisotropy and mean diffusivity-based indices of white matter microstructure  measures in 56 older adults with remitted late-life depression. RESULTS: Higher SASP  index was significantly correlated with older age (r\,=\,0.42, p\,=\,0.001) and worse  executive function performance (r = -0.27, p\,=\,0.04). After controlling for the  effect of age, overall cognitive performance, and white matter hyperintensities, the  association between SASP and left and right cingulate bundle mean diffusivity  remained statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that, in the  context of late-life depression, SASP proteins are associated with microstructural  abnormalities in white matter tracts in brain and worse executive function  performance.},

The checklist model rests on faulty assumptions about the nature of information available through the Web, mistaken beliefs about student evaluation skills, and an exaggerated sense of librarian expertise in evaluating information. The checklist model is difficult to implement in practice and encourages a mechanistic way of evaluating that is at odds with critical thinking. A contextual approach is offered as an alternative. A contextual approach uses three techniques: promoting peer- and editorially-reviewed resources, comparison, and corroboration. The contextual approach promotes library resources, teaches information literacy, and encourages reasoned judgments of information quality.},

Il était donc indispensable de réinventer la façon dont les référentiels de compétences abordent le numérique. L’UNESCO ou la Commission européenne ont pris cette voie, tout comme le Québec, et ont décidé d’associer des compétences de haut niveau (ex. la pensée critique, la culture de l’information) à la compétence numérique, pour que celle-ci ne se limite pas à des habiletés instrumentales telles qu’allumer un ordinateur, ouvrir son fureteur et se rendre sur un moteur de recherche. La compétence numérique est en fait une nécessité sociétale dont il faut prendre la mesure pour ne pas créer de nouvelles fractures. Quelques situations pédagogiques au postsecondaire permettent d’illustrer la façon dont la compétence numérique peut être abordée dans différentes matières.},

Results of recent research and controlled studies, based on a PubMed search, are emphasized and compared with earlier reports. The recent increase of interest in this form of therapy for ADHD, and especially in the use of omega supplements, significance of iron deficiency, and the avoidance of the "Western pattern" diet, make the discussion timely. Diets to reduce symptoms associated with ADHD include sugar-restricted, additive/preservative-free, oligoantigenic/elimination, and fatty acid supplements. Omega-3 supplement is the latest dietary treatment with positive reports of efficacy, and interest in the additive-free diet of the 1970s is occasionally revived. A provocative report draws attention to the ADHD-associated "Western-style" diet, high in fat and refined sugars, and the ADHD-free "healthy" diet, containing fiber, folate, and omega-3 fatty acids. The literature on diets and ADHD, listed by PubMed, is reviewed with emphasis on recent controlled studies. Recommendations for the use of diets are based on current opinion of published reports and our practice experience. Indications for dietary therapy include medication failure, parental or patient preference, iron deficiency, and, when appropriate, change from an ADHD-linked Western diet to an ADHD-free healthy diet. Foods associated with ADHD to be avoided and those not linked with ADHD and preferred are listed. In practice, additive-free and oligoantigenic/elimination diets are time-consuming and disruptive to the household; they are indicated only in selected patients. Iron and zinc are supplemented in patients with known deficiencies; they may also enhance the effectiveness of stimulant therapy. In patients failing to respond or with parents opposed to medication, omega-3 supplements may warrant a trial. A greater attention to the education of parents and children in a healthy dietary pattern, omitting items shown to predispose to ADHD, is perhaps the most promising and practical complementary or alternative treatment of ADHD.},

Coloring materials aka 'dyes' aren't just for fabrics but have been added to various types of food to enhance their appeal. Evidently, this coloring chemicals have their origin in natural products, which later expanded to the huge market of artificial food dyes. Artificial food colorings have been in the controversy for many years and scrutinized for being possibly linked to cancer, allergies and hyperactivity. Globally, natural as well as artificial dyes are being cautiously researched and regulated by the food safety authorities. In India, the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 (now called the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006), has been implemented for the quality assurance of various types of foods and food products, and only eight dyes have been suggested edible, but within prescribed limits. The present article explores the history and journey of these captivating materials which have been brightening our world for more than 3500 years, along with a detailed overview of their physical and chemical properties, and the usage and toxicity of the eight permissible food dyes in India.},

METHODS: A longitudinal data analysis of 186 homeless veterans enrolled in a  six-month residential rehabilitation and addiction treatment program was conducted  to investigate the role of six different emotion regulation variables as well the  impact of two relationship quality constructs when measured at three time points  across treatment. RESULTS: A large effect size reduction in depressive symptoms  occurred during treatment (η(2) = .233), and further analyses revealed that early  treatment changes in a single subtype of emotion regulation, one's ability to  tolerate distress while engaging in goal-directed behavior, was the only mechanism  that preceded continued reductions in depressive symptoms later in treatment (β =  .13, p {$<$} .001). Social mechanisms of change were not strong predictors of depressive  symptom reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Distress tolerance skills, psychoeducation on the  habituation process, and focusing on goal achievement may be particularly beneficial  when treating substance use issues in homeless veterans who are also experiencing  depressive symptoms during residential treatment.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study tested the hypothesis that use of semantic organizational strategy in approaching the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS) complex verbal  initiation/perseveration (CV I/P) task, a test of semantic fluency, is the function  specifically associated with remission of late-life depression. METHOD: Seventy  elders with major depression participated in a 12-week escitalopram treatment trial.  Neuropsychologic performance was assessed at baseline after a 2-week drug washout  period. Patients with a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale Score ≤7 for 2 consecutive  weeks and who no longer met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,  Fourth Edition, criteria were considered to be remitted. Cox's proportional hazards  survival analysis was used to examine the relationship between subtests of the I/P,  other neuropsychologic domains, and remission rate. Participants' performance on the  CV I/P subscale was coded for perseverations, and use of semantic strategy. RESULTS:  The relationship between the performance on the CV I/P subscale and remission rate  was significant. No other subtest of the MDRS I/P evidenced this association. There  was no significant relationship between speed, confrontation naming, verbal memory,  or perseveration with remission rate. Remitters' use of verbal strategy was  significantly greater than nonremitters. CONCLUSIONS: Geriatric depressed patients  who showed decrements in performance on a semantic fluency task showed poorer  remission rates than those who showed adequate performance on this measure.  Executive impairment in verbal strategy explained performance. This finding supports  the concept that executive functioning exerts a "top down" effect on other basic  cognitive processes, perhaps as a result of frontostriatal network dysfunction  implicated in geriatric depression.},

Here we develop  a neuroplasticity-based computerized cognitive remediation-geriatric depression  treatment (nCCR-GD) to target ED in GD. Our assumption is that remediation of these  deficits may modulate the underlying brain network abnormalities shared by ED and  depression. We compare nCCR-GD to a gold-standard treatment (escitalopram: 20\,mg per  12 weeks) in 11 treatment-resistant older adults with major depression; and 33  matched historical controls. We find that 91\% of participants complete nCCR-GD.  nCCR-GD is equally as effective at reducing depressive symptoms as escitalopram but  does so in 4 weeks instead of 12. In addition, nCCR-GD improves measures of  executive function more than the escitalopram. We conclude that nCCR-GD may be  equally effective as escitalopram in treating GD. In addition, nCCR-GD participants  showed greater improvement in executive functions than historical controls treated  with escitalopram.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study tests the hypothesis that the use of semantic organizational strategy during the free-recall phase of a verbal memory task predicts remission of  geriatric depression. METHODS: Sixty-five older patients with major depression  participated in a 12-week escitalopram treatment trial. Neuropsychological  performance was assessed at baseline after a 2-week drug washout period. The Hopkins  Verbal Learning Test-Revised was used to assess verbal learning and memory.  Remission was defined as a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score of ≤ 7 for 2  consecutive weeks and no longer meeting the DSM-IV-TR criteria for major depression.  The association between the number of clusters used at the final learning trial  (trial 3) and remission was examined using Cox's proportional hazards survival  analysis. The relationship between the number of clusters utilized in the final  learning trial and the number of words recalled after a 25-min delay was examined in  a regression with age and education as covariates. RESULTS: Higher number of  clusters utilized predicted remission rates (hazard ratio, 1.26 (95\% confidence  interval, 1.04-1.54); χ(2) \,=\,4.23, df\,=\,3, p\,=\,0.04). There was a positive  relationship between the total number of clusters used by the end of the third  learning trial and the total number of words recalled at the delayed recall trial  (F(3,58)\,=\,7.93; p\,{$<$}\,0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Effective semantic strategy use at  baseline on a verbal list learning task by older depressed patients was associated  with higher rates of remission with antidepressant treatment. This result provides  support for previous findings indicating that measures of executive functioning at  baseline are useful in predicting antidepressant response.},

Cognitive impairments such as executive  dysfunction are well documented in late-life major depression; however, little  progress has been made in assessing associations of these impairments with financial  incapacity. METHODS: Participants included 95 clinically depressed and 41  nondepressed older adults without dementia. Financial capacity (assessed with the  Managing Money scale of the Independent Living Scale), cognitive functioning  (comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation), and depression severity (Hamilton  Depression Rating Scale - 24) were assessed. T tests were used to assess group  differences. Linear regression was used to analyze data. RESULTS: Depressed  participants performed significantly lower on financial capacity (t = 2.98, p {$<$}  .01). Among depressed participants, executive functioning (B = .24, p {$<$} .05) was  associated with reduced financial capacity, controlling for age, gender, education,  depression severity, and other cognitive domains. CONCLUSIONS: Our results  underscore the importance of assessing financial capacity in older depressed adults  as they are likely vulnerable to financial abuse even in the absence of dementia. It  will be valuable to assess whether treatment for depression is an effective  intervention to improve outcomes.},

  abstract = {The scientific consensus on human-caused global warming has been a topic of intense interest in recent decades. This is in part due to the important role of public perception of expert consensus, which has downstream impacts on public opinion and support for mitigation policies. Numerous studies, using diverse methodologies and measures of climate expertise, have quantified the scientific consensus, finding between 90\% and 100\% agreement on human-caused global warming with multiple studies converging on 97\% agreement. This study revisits the consensus among geoscientists ten years after an initial survey of experts, while exploring different ways to define expertise and the level of agreement among these groups. We sent 10 929 invitations to participate in our survey to a verified email list of geosciences faculty at reporting academic and research institutions and received 2780 responses. In addition to analyzing the raw survey results, we independently quantify how many publications self-identified climate experts published in the field of climate change research and compare that to their survey response on questions about climate change. As well as a binary approach classifying someone as ‘expert’ or ‘non-expert’, we also look at expertise as a scale. We find that agreement on anthropogenic global warming is high (91\% to 100\%) and generally increases with expertise. Out of a group of 153 independently confirmed climate experts, 98.7\% of those scientists indicated that the Earth is getting warmer mostly because of human activity such as burning fossil fuels. Among those with the highest level of expertise (independently confirmed climate experts who each published 20+ peer reviewed papers on climate change between 2015 and 2019) there was 100\% agreement that the Earth is warming mostly because of human activity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: We previously reported a randomized, sham-controlled trial of 5 Hz dorsolateral prefrontal left- and right-side repetitive transcranial  magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in 48 participants with a medically refractory major  depressive disorder. Depression improved most with right-side cranial stimulation,  both rTMS and sham, and to a lesser degree with left rTMS. Because depression is  often associated with cognitive impairment, in this study we sought to determine  whether our earlier participants had treatment-induced changes in cognition, which  cognitive domains (language, executive, visuospatial, verbal episodic memory,  attention) were affected, and whether treatment-induced cognitive changes were  related either to improvement in depression or to other treatment variables, such as  right versus left treatment and rTMS versus sham. METHODS: We used hierarchical  regression analyses to determine how variables measured at baseline or associated  with treatment affected changes in neuropsychological functions. The variables were  neuropsychological function in the 5 domains, severity of depression, change in  depression with treatment, rTMS versus sham, laterality of stimulation, and  rTMS-laterality interaction. RESULTS: Compared to sham, right rTMS was associated  with 1.24 standard deviations greater gain in language function, 1.09 standard  deviations greater gain in visuospatial function, and 2.38 standard deviations  greater gain in verbal episodic memory than left rTMS. These improvements did not  appear to be directly related to the relief from depression. CONCLUSIONS: Our  results suggest that disorders of cognition and mood in depression may have  different mechanisms, but right rTMS may treat both. We propose potential mechanisms  underlying the right-side rTMS effect. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION:  Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00711568.},

One of the most important factors potentially contributing to  inconsistencies between studies may be the influence of medications. To explore the  influence of antidepressants on cognitive performance in remitted MDD, we evaluated  memory and executive functions using Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised and Stroop Color  and Word Test, and compared performance among 50 medicated (29 treated with  tricyclic antidepressants [TCA], 21 treated with selective serotonin reuptake  inhibitors or serotonin noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors) and 19 medication-free MDD  patients and 31 controls. The results showed that all 3 MDD groups had significantly  lower performance for verbal memory compared with controls. Both medicated groups  showed significantly lower performance for visual memory compared with controls;  however, the medication-free group did not differ from controls. For the executive  function, only the TCA group showed a significantly lower performance compared with  controls. These results suggest that cognitive impairment remained even in remitted  patients with MDD, however, part of this impairment may be influenced by  class-specific antidepressant side effects.},

Evidence for a dysexecutive  syndrome and semantic access impairments has been discussed in positive FTD, albeit  focusing mostly on patients with schizophrenia. We investigated the correlation of  the full range of positive and negative as well as subjective and objective FTD with  neuropsychological domains in different patient groups. Patients with ICD-10  schizophrenia (n = 51), depression (n = 51), and bipolar mania (n = 18), as well as  healthy subjects (n = 60), were interviewed with the Rating Scale for the Assessment  of Objective and Subjective Formal Thought and Language Disorder (TALD) and assessed  using a multidimensional neuropsychological test battery (executive function,  semantic and lexical verbal fluency, attention, working memory, and abstract  thinking). Partial correlation analysis, controlling for age and word knowledge,  revealed significant results for the objective positive FTD dimension and executive  dysfunctions. Objective negative FTD was associated with deficits in lexico-semantic  retrieval, as well as attention and working memory dysfunctions. The results suggest  that different neuropsychological substrates correlate with the multidimensional and  phenomenologically different FTD syndromes. FTD is a complex, multidimensional  syndrome with a variety of neuropsychological impairments, which should be accounted  for in future studies investigating the pathogenesis of FTD.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To compare the dual-task gait performance of older adults with Late-Life Depression (LLD) versus Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). DESIGN: Cross-sectional  study with three matched groups: LLD, MCI and non-depressed and cognitively intact  (NDCI). SETTING: LLD group participants were recruited from geriatric psychiatry  clinics in London, Ontario. Matched participants meeting criteria for the MCI or  NDCI groups were previously recruited for other research studies from geriatric  clinics and the community. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 60-85 who met criteria for  mild-moderate LLD (N=23) without a diagnosis of a neurocognitive disorder.  MEASUREMENTS: Participants completed questionnaires regarding mood, cognition and  physical activity. Gait speed was recorded using an electronic walkway during simple  and dual-task gait (walking while naming animals aloud). Dual-task cost (DTC) is the  percentage change in gait speed between simple and dual-task gait. It is a  clinically relevant indicator of fall risk and is strongly associated with cognitive  decline. For comparison, 23 MCI and 23 NDCI participants, matched with respect to  age, sex and comorbidities, were randomly selected from existing research databases.  RESULTS: Each group had 8 males and 15 females, with mean age of 69.0-69.6 years.  The mean (±SD) DTC of the NDCI, LLD and MCI groups were statistically different at  2.4±11.4\%, 11.8±9.9\% and 22.2±16.7\%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Older adults with LLD  perform worse on dual-task gait than NDCI; however, they are less impaired than  those with MCI. The elevated DTC seen in LLD is likely because of underlying  executive dysfunction that is less significant than in those with MCI.},

Ainsi s'ouvre l'éventail de notre désir de liberté dans quatre domaines (et autant de «~chants » que composent son nouvel essai) : sexe, art, drogues, climat. « Je m’attacherai à observer comment la liberté semble s’enchevêtrer à la non-liberté pour produire des expériences teintées de compulsion, de discipline, de possible, d’abdication. » Et produire de nouvelles manières d’être.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: People with diabetes must engage in several self-care activities to manage blood glucose; cognitive function and other affective disorders may affect  self-care behaviors. We examined the executive function domain of cognition,  depressive symptoms, and symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) to determine  which common mental conditions can co-occur with diabetes are associated with blood  glucose levels. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional in-person survey of 563  rural older adults (age 60 years or older) with diabetes that included African  Americans, American Indians, and Whites from eight counties in south-central North  Carolina. Hemoglobin A1C (A1C) was measured from a finger-stick blood sample to  assess blood glucose control. Executive function, depressive symptoms, and symptoms  of GAD were assessed using established measures and scoring procedures. Separate  multivariate linear regression models were used to examine the association of  executive function, depressive symptoms, and symptoms of GAD with A1C. RESULTS:  Adjusting for potential confounders including age, gender, education, ethnicity,  marital status, history of stroke, heart disease, hypertension, diabetes knowledge,  and duration of diabetes, executive function was significantly associated with A1C  levels: every one-unit increase in executive function was associated with a 0.23  lower A1C value (p\,=\,0.02). Symptoms of depression and GAD were not associated with  A1C levels. CONCLUSIONS: Low executive function is potentially a barrier to  self-care, the cornerstone of managing blood glucose levels. Training aids that  compensate for cognitive impairments may be essential for achieving effective  glucose control.},

  abstract = {Background: Treatment responses to methylphenidate by adults with ADHD are generally monitored against DSM-IV/DSM-V symptomatology, rating scales or interviews during reviews.Aims: To evaluate the use of single- and dual-dimension processing-speed and efficiency measures to monitor the effects of pharmacological treatment with methylphenidate after a short period off medication.Methods: A Quick Test of Cognitive Speed (AQT) monitored the effects of immediate-release methylphenidate in 40 previously diagnosed and medicated adults with ADHD. Processing speed was evaluated with prior prescription medication, without medication after a 2-day period off ADHD medication, and with low-dose (10/20mg) and high-dose (20/40mg) methylphenidate hydrochloride (Medikinet IR).Results: Thirty-three participants responded to the experimental treatments. One-way ANOVA with post-hoc analysis (Scheffe) indicated significant main effects for single dimension colour and form and dual-dimension colour-form naming. Post-hoc analysis indicated statistical differences between the no- and high-dose medication conditions for colour and form, measures of perceptual speed. For colour-form naming, a measure of cognitive speed, there was a significant difference between no- and low-dose medication and between no- and high-dose medications, but not between low- and high-dose medications.Conclusions: Results indicated that the AQT tests effectively monitored incremental effects of the methylphenidate dose on processing speed after a 2-day period off medication. Thus, perceptual (colour and form) and cognitive speed (two-dimensional colour-form naming) and processing efficiency (lowered shift costs) increased measurably with high-dose medication. These preliminary findings warrant validation with added measures of associated behavioural and cognitive changes.},

Method: Color (C), form (F), and color-form (CF) combination naming were administered to 69 adults during outpatient evaluation, and pre- and posttreatment results were compared for 64 adults. Results: At intake without medication, naming times (s) were significantly longer and overhead, CF - (C + F), larger than after stabilization of ADHD symptoms. Means for single-dimension naming were in the normal range, and for CF and overhead, means were in the atypical ranges. After treatment, CF and overhead improved to within normal ranges. On average, dual-dimension processing speed increased by 31\% and efficiency by 73\%. Sensitivity at intake was 91\%, using fail-criteria for CF and/or overhead. Conclusion: Results support previous estimates of sensitivity and ability to monitor pharmacological-treatment effects in ADHD. (J. of Att. Dis. 2013; 17(3)187-193)},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The role of diet and of food colors in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or its symptoms warrants updated quantitative meta-analysis, in light of recent divergent policy in Europe and the United States. METHOD: Studies were identified through a literature search using the PubMed, Cochrane Library, and PsycNET databases through February 2011. Twenty-four publications met inclusion criteria for synthetic food colors; 10 additional studies informed analysis of dietary restriction. A random-effects meta-analytic model generated summary effect sizes. RESULTS: Restriction diets reduced ADHD symptoms at an effect of g = 0.29 (95\% CI, 0.07-0.53). For food colors, parent reports yielded an effect size of g = 0.18 (95\% CI, 0.08-0.24; p = .0007), which decreased to 0.12 (95\% CI, 0.01-0.23; p {$<$} .05) after adjustment for possible publication bias. The effect was reliable in studies restricted to food color additives (g = 0.21, 95\% CI = 0.06-0.36) but did not survive correction for possible publication bias and was not reliable in studies confined to Food and Drug Administration-approved food colors. Teacher/observer reports yielded a nonsignificant effect of 0.07 (95\% CI = -0.03 to 0.18; p = .14). However, high-quality studies confined to color additives yielded a reliable effect (g = 0.22, 95\% CI = 0.10-0.41, p = .030) that survived correction. In psychometric tests of attention, the summary effect size was 0.27 (95\% CI = 0.07-0.47; p = .007) and survived correction. An estimated 8\% of children with ADHD may have symptoms related to synthetic food colors. CONCLUSIONS: A restriction diet benefits some children with ADHD. Effects of food colors were notable were but susceptible to publication bias or were derived from small, nongeneralizable samples. Renewed investigation of diet and ADHD is warranted.},

Previous studies have reached conflicting conclusions about the effects of exposure to counter-attitudinal information. As fact-checking has become more prominent, it is therefore worth examining how respondents respond to fact-checks of politicians—a question with important implications for understanding the effects of this journalistic format on elections. We present results to two experiments conducted during the 2016 campaign that test the effects of exposure to realistic journalistic fact-checks of claims made by Donald Trump during his convention speech and a general election debate. These messages improved the accuracy of respondents’ factual beliefs, even among his supporters, but had no measurable effect on attitudes toward Trump. These results suggest that journalistic fact-checks can reduce misperceptions but often have minimal effects on candidate evaluations or vote choice.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to investigate whether cognitive reserve moderated the association between depressive symptoms and cognition, as well as  brain volumes in a sample of older adults. METHODS: Non-demented participants (n =  3484) were selected from the Washington Heights/Hamilton Heights Inwood Columbia  Aging Project (Northern Manhattan). A subsample of these participants without  dementia (n = 703), who had brain imaging data, was also selected for a separate  analysis. Depressive symptomatology was assessed with the 10-item Center for  Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Reading level and years of education were  used as measures of cognitive reserve. Four distinct cognitive composite scores were  calculated: executive function, memory, visual-spatial, and language. RESULTS:  Multiple regression analysis revealed interaction effects between both measures of  cognitive reserve and depressive symptoms on all the cognitive outcome measures  except for visual-spatial ability. Those with greater reserve showed greater  cognitive decrements than those with lower levels of reserve as depressive symptoms  increased. A borderline interaction effect was revealed between reading level and  depressive symptoms on total brain volumes. Those with lower reading scores showed  greater volume loss as depressive symptoms increased than those with higher reading  scores. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the association between late-life  depressive symptoms and core aspects of cognition varies depending on one's level of  cognitive reserve. Those that had greater levels of education and/or reading ability  showed a greater decrease in memory, executive, and language performances as  depressive symptoms increased than those with lower years of education and reading  ability.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Severe depression is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Neural network dysfunction may contribute to disease mechanisms underlying different  clinical subtypes. Here, we apply resting-state functional magnetic resonance  imaging based measures of brain connectivity to investigate network dysfunction in  severely depressed in-patients with and without psychotic symptoms. METHODS: A  cohort study was performed at two sites. Older patients with major depressive  disorder with or without psychotic symptoms were included (n = 23 at site one, n =  26 at site two). Resting state 3-Tesla functional MRI scans, with eyes closed, were  obtained and Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scales were completed. We denoised  data and calculated resting state networks in the two groups separately. We selected  five networks of interest (1. bilateral frontoparietal, 2.left lateralized  frontoparietal, 3.right lateralized frontoparietal, 4.default mode network (DMN) and  5.bilateral basal ganglia and insula network) and performed regression analyses with  severity of depression, as well as presence or absence of psychotic symptoms.  RESULTS: The functional connectivity (FC) patterns did not correlate with severity  of depression. Depressed patients with psychotic symptoms (n = 14, 61\%) compared  with patients without psychotic symptoms (n = 9, 39\%) from site one showed  significantly decreased FC in the right part of the bilateral frontoparietal network  (p = 0.002). This result was not replicated when comparing patients with (n = 9,  35\%) and without (n = 17, 65\%) psychotic symptoms from site two. CONCLUSION:  Psychotic depression may be associated with decreased FC of the frontoparietal  network, which is involved in cognitive control processes, such as attention and  emotion regulation. These findings suggest that FC in the frontoparietal network may  be related to the subtype of depression, i.e. presence of psychotic symptoms, rather  than severity of depression. Since the findings could not be replicated in the 2nd  sample, replication is needed before drawing definite conclusions.},

  abstract = {Purpose Fruits and vegetables, being good source of energy, health promoting and protecting compounds with unique taste and flavor, are attracting consumers since ages. These horticultural produces start deterioration just after harvest; therefore, their proper storage is must during transportation and storage to retain maximum quality parameters and for good market value. Best storage conditions are required to prevent growth of micro flora and to maintain the nutritional values of harvested produce. Retailers and processors in every corner of world want to move toward the cheaper ways to increase the shelf life and texture of horticultural crops for better consumer preference. The purpose of this paper is to make consumers and researchers aware about different post harvest malpractices in fresh fruits and vegetables. Design/methodology/approach Lot of chemicals like colors, artificial ripening agents, sweeteners and waxes are applied on surface of horticulture produce to siphon off money from consumers, and these have adverse health effects directly or indirectly. Various regulatory agencies have launched various programs, acts and laws for monitoring and avoiding such unhealthy ways. Regulatory bodies launched training programs also for the food handlers and consumers to ensure the food safety from farm to fork. Findings This paper will throw light on different malpractices followed by retailers to manipulate the quality which causes adverse health effects and to create consumer awareness regarding such malpractices. Originality/value The paper emphasizes on current malpractices followed by retailers to mislead the consumers about fruits' and vegetable' quality by using sweeteners, colors and other chemical. On prolonged consumption, such substances lead to major health issues such as attention disorder.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Previous studies on cognitive deficits in acute and remitted states of old-age depression have shown mixed findings. The episodic nature of depression  makes repeated assessment of cognitive performance important in order to address  reversibility and stability of cognitive deficits. METHODS: Dementia-free older  participants (≥60\,years) from the population-based Swedish National Study on Aging  and Care in Kungsholmen who completed neuropsychological testing at baseline (T1)  and follow-up (T2) formed the basis of the study sample. Participants were grouped  according to depression status at T1 and T2: depressed-remitted (n\,=\,32),  remitted-depressed (n\,=\,45), and nondepressed-depressed (n\,=\,29). These groups were  compared with a group of randomly selected and matched (age, gender, education, and  follow-up time) healthy controls (n\,=\,106) over a period of maximum 6\,years.  RESULTS: Mixed ANCOVAs, controlling for age and gender, revealed depression-related  deficits for processing speed, attention, executive function, and category fluency.  In remitted states, only processing speed and attention were affected. However,  these deficits were attenuated after exclusion of persons using benzodiazepine  medications. A general pattern of cognitive decline was observed across all groups  for processing speed, executive function, category fluency, and episodic and  semantic memory; persons transitioning from a nondepressed to depressed state tended  to show exacerbated cognitive decline. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the notion  that cognitive deficits in depression may be more transient than stable.  Consequently, cognitive deficits in depression might be regarded as potential  treatment targets rather than stable vulnerabilities. As such, repeated assessment  of cognitive functioning may provide an additional marker of treatment response.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the natural course of depressive symptoms among community-dwelling elderly over 5 years. Rates and correlates of the incidence and  the persistence of late-life depression were examined. METHODS: A total of 701  elderly people 65 years of age or older without dementia at baseline were included  in this study. The association between categorically defined late-life depression  (score of ≥ 8 on the Korean version of the Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form)  and possible lifestyle and clinical risk factors, including physical activity  assessed with a modified Korean version of the International Physical Activity  Questionnaire (IPAQ) and transformed into weekly Metabolic Equivalent Task (MET)  values, was longitudinally investigated using multiple logistic regression analyses.  Adjustment was done with sociodemographic variables, chronic medical illnesses, and  cognitive dysfunction. RESULTS: During the 5-year follow-up, 74 (26.5\%) of the  non-depressed elderly developed depression, whereas 30 (49.2\%) of the depressed  elderly experienced persistent depression. Above-moderate baseline physical activity  was independently associated with decreased incidence and persistence rates of  late-life depression (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)\,= 0.44, 95\% confidence interval  (CI)\,= 0.22-0.85; AOR\,= 0.17, 95\% CI = 0.03-0.92, respectively), whereas mild  physical activity was not. Conversely, poorer executive function also predicted  5-year incident depression (AOR\,= 0.93, 95\% CI = 0.89-0.98) but not persistent  depression. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that a minimum of moderate physical  activity is related to both emergent and persistent depression in elderly  individuals. Research with an extended follow-up period and a shorter  inter-assessment interval is needed to confirm this result.},

METHODS: Cognitive complaints were  assessed with the Checklist for Cognitive and Emotional Consequences following  stroke (CLCE-24) in 111 persons who visited our outpatient clinic 3 months after  SAH. Associations between cognitive complaints and cognitive functioning,  demographic characteristics, disability and emotional problems were examined using  Spearman correlations and linear regression analysis. RESULTS: In this study group,  105 patients (94.6\%) reported at least one cognitive or emotional complaint that  hampered everyday functioning. The most frequently reported cognitive complaints  were mental slowness, short-term memory problems and attention deficits. All  cognitive domains, disability, depressive symptoms and feelings of anxiety were  significantly associated with the CLCE-24 cognition score. In the final regression  model, memory functioning (beta value -0.21), disability (-0.28) and depressive  symptoms (0.40) were significant determinants of cognitive complaints, together  explaining 35.4\% of the variance. CONCLUSION: Cognitive complaints are common after  SAH and associated with memory deficits, disability and depressive symptoms.  Rehabilitation programs should focus on these symptoms and deficits.},

All three conditions are  independently associated with negative health outcomes including impaired function,  risk of falling, and reduced quality of life. However, the existence, etiology, and  implications of having all three conditions as a unitary triad remain unclear. This  systematic review examined the literature to assess the consistency of this triad  and to explore the possible role of frontal-subcortical circuitry in its etiology.  English language literature that assessed mood, executive function, and gait speed  using a validated tool in human participants over age 65 were included for this  review. Following the PRISMA guidelines, 15 studies including 11,213 participants  met criteria for inclusion in this study. The triad's existence was supported by 12  of the 15 studies (80\%), including 4 longitudinal studies involving 368  participants. A prevalence of 17\% was reported in one population study. The three  included intervention studies provided mixed results regarding the benefit of  pharmacologic and exercise interventions. Two studies assessed the association  between presence of white matter hyperintensities and the triad, with one study  finding a significant longitudinal relationship with periventricular white matter  hyperintensities. Vascular risk factors were also commonly associated with this  triad. Taken together, the relationship between this triad, the vascular depression  hypothesis, and frontal-subcortical pathology is suggested. Further longitudinal  research is needed to further clarify the etiology and clinical relevance of this  concomitant prescence oflate-life depression, executive dysfunction and impaired  gait speed.},

Regression analyses were performed to determine the extent to which  executive dysfunctions contributed to episodic memory impairments. When compared  with healthy controls, significantly lower episodic memory and executive functioning  performances were found for depressed patients of all age groups. Effect sizes  appeared to vary across different memory and executive functioning measures. The  extent to which executive dysfunctions could explain episodic memory impairments  varied depending on the type of measure examined. These findings emphasise the need  to consider memory-related functioning of depressed patients in the context of  therapeutic treatments.},

  abstract = {Misinformation can amplify humanity's greatest challenges. A salient recent example of this is the COVID-19 pandemic, which has bred a multitude of falsehoods even as truth has increasingly become a matter of life-and-death. Here we investigate why people believe and spread false (and true) news content about COVID-19, and test an intervention intended to increase the truthfulness of the content people share on social media. Across two studies with over 1,600 participants (quota-matched to the American public on age, gender, ethnicity and geographic region), we find support for the idea that people share false claims about COVID-19 in part because they simply fail to think sufficiently about whether or not content is accurate when deciding what to share. In Study 1, participants were far worse at discerning between true and false content when deciding what they would share on social media relative to when they are asked directly about accuracy. Furthermore, participants who engaged in more analytic thinking and had greater science knowledge were more discerning in their belief and sharing. In Study 2, we found that a simple accuracy reminder at the beginning of the study – i.e., asking people to judge the accuracy of a non-COVID-19-related headline – more than doubled the level of truth discernment in participants’ sharing intentions. In the control, participants were equally like to say they would share false versus true headlines at COVID-19 whereas, in the treatment, sharing of true headlines was significantly higher than false headlines. Our results – which mirror those found previously for political fake news – suggest that nudging people to think about accuracy is a simple way to improve choices about what to share on social media. Accuracy nudges are straightforward for social media platforms to implement on top of the other approaches they are currently employing, and could have an immediate positive impact on stemming the tide of misinformation about the COVID-19 outbreak.},

  abstract = {What can be done to combat political misinformation? One prominent intervention involves attaching warnings to headlines of news stories that have been disputed by third-party fact-checkers. Here we demonstrate a hitherto unappreciated potential consequence of such a warning: an implied truth effect, whereby false headlines that fail to get tagged are considered validated and thus are seen as more accurate. With a formal model, we demonstrate that Bayesian belief updating can lead to such an implied truth effect. In Study 1 (n = 5,271 MTurkers), we find that although warnings do lead to a modest reduction in perceived accuracy of false headlines relative to a control condition (particularly for politically concordant headlines), we also observed the hypothesized implied truth effect: the presence of warnings caused untagged headlines to be seen as more accurate than in the control. In Study 2 (n = 1,568 MTurkers), we find the same effects in the context of decisions about which headlines to consider sharing on social media. We also find that attaching verifications to some true headlines—which removes the ambiguity about whether untagged headlines have not been checked or have been verified—eliminates, and in fact slightly reverses, the implied truth effect. Together these results contest theories of motivated reasoning while identifying a potential challenge for the policy of using warning tags to fight misinformation—a challenge that is particularly concerning given that it is much easier to produce misinformation than it is to debunk it.This paper was accepted by Elke Weber, judgment and decision making.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder (BD) and unipolar disorder (UD) are associated with cognitive deficits and abnormal neural activity in a "cognitive control network."  There is an increased prevalence of cognitive dysfunction in psychiatric patients'  first-degree relatives, which constitutes a risk factor for psychiatric illness  onset. However, there is no treatment with enduring pro-cognitive efficacy. We found  preliminary evidence for beneficial effects of eight weekly doses of recombinant  human erythropoietin (EPO) on cognition in BD in a recent randomized controlled  trial (RCT). The present RCT consists of two sub-studies that extend our previous  work by investigating important novel aspects: (1) the effects of 12 weekly doses of  EPO on cognition in first-degree relatives of patients with BD, UD, or  schizophrenia; and (2) the effects of extending the treatment schedule from 8 to  12~weeks in remitted patients with BD or UD; and (3) assessment of early  treatment-associated neural activity changes that may predict cognitive improvement.  METHODS: The trial comprises two parallel sub-studies with randomized, controlled,  double-blinded, parallel group designs. First-degree relatives (sub-study 1; n\,=\,52)  and partially or fully remitted patients with BD or UD (sub-study 2; n\,=\,52) with  objectively verified cognitive dysfunction are randomized to receive weekly  high-dose EPO (40,000~IU/mL) or placebo (saline) infusions for 12~weeks. Assessments  of cognition and mood are conducted at baseline, after two~weeks of treatment, after  treatment completion, and at six-month follow-up. Functional magnetic resonance  imaging (fMRI) is conducted at baseline and after two~weeks of treatment.  Psychosocial function is assessed at baseline, after treatment completion and  six-month follow-up. The primary outcome is change in a cognitive composite score of  attention, verbal memory, and executive functions. Statistical power of ≥\,80\% is  reached to detect a clinically relevant between-group difference by including 52  first-degree relatives and 52 patients with BD or UD, respectively. Behavioral data  are analyzed with an intention-to-treat approach using mixed models. fMRI data are  analyzed with the FMRIB Software Library. DISCUSSION: If this trial reveals  pro-cognitive effects of EPO, this may influence future treatment of mood disorders  and/or preventive strategies in at-risk populations. The fMRI analyses may unravel  key neurobiological targets for pro-cognitive treatment. TRIAL REGISTRATION:  ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT03315897. Registered on 20 October 2017.},

Despite its increasing use, to date no article reflecting use of scoping review methodology has been submitted for review at JAANP. The purpose of this article is to provide detailed information on scoping reviews, including definition, related processes, and uses, and discuss the relationship to nurse practitioner (NP) practice, policy, education, and research. The longer-term goal is that NPs will understand the related techniques, consider the methodology as a viable one for NP scholarship, and bring related reports to the forefront of NP publications. Methods This manuscript represents a brief report. Processes to develop the brief include detailed search and review of scoping review literature in CINAHL and PubMed. Both methodologic reports and reviews were included. Definitions and uses of scoping reviews were reviewed. Conclusion The definition and process of scoping review are evolving. Although there is controversy regarding the methodology, there is increasing visibility of scoping review methodology in the published literature since the year 2000, with over 500 published reviews currently available. Implications for practice A well-executed scoping review has potential to inform NP practice, policy, education, and research.},

In this study we investigated emotion perception  skills involved in decoding facial expressions of emotion in healthy older adults,  compared with those with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or late-life mood disorder (MD).  Although those with MD were mildly impaired in identifying emotional expressions,  this was not caused by negative biases in choosing labels. Emotion decoding  performance in AD was much more impaired, particularly when relatively subtle  expressions were presented. Difficulties in choosing between labels to describe an  emotional face were predicted by executive dysfunction, whereas impaired ability to  match 2 emotional faces was related to general difficulties with face perception.  Across all 3 groups, problems with emotion perception predicted quality of life  independently of variance predicted by cognitive function and mood, indicating the  potential importance of emotion decoding skills in the well-being of older adults.},

They gleefully whip the media into a frenzy over a fake teen drug crisis; they post offensive messages on Facebook memorial pages, traumatizing grief-stricken friends and family; they use unabashedly racist language and images. They take pleasure in ruining a complete stranger's day and find amusement in their victim's anguish. In short, trolling is the obstacle to a kinder, gentler Internet. To quote a famous Internet meme, trolling is why we can't have nice things online. Or at least that's what we have been led to believe. In this provocative book, Whitney Phillips argues that trolling, widely condemned as obscene and deviant, actually fits comfortably within the contemporary media landscape. Trolling may be obscene, but, Phillips argues, it isn't all that deviant. Trolls' actions are born of and fueled by culturally sanctioned impulses—which are just as damaging as the trolls' most disruptive behaviors. Phillips describes, for example, the relationship between trolling and sensationalist corporate media—pointing out that for trolls, exploitation is a leisure activity; for media, it's a business strategy. She shows how trolls, “the grimacing poster children for a socially networked world,” align with social media. And she documents how trolls, in addition to parroting media tropes, also offer a grotesque pantomime of dominant cultural tropes, including gendered notions of dominance and success and an ideology of entitlement. We don't just have a trolling problem, Phillips argues; we have a culture problem. This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things isn't only about trolls; it's about a culture in which trolls thrive.},

The purpose of this review is to clarify  which aspects of executive functioning predict poor antidepressant treatment  response. METHODS: Literature review. RESULTS: From our review, the aspects of  executive functioning that appear to be associated with antidepressant response  rates are verbal fluency and response inhibition. There is some indication that the  semantic strategy component may account for the effects of verbal fluency, although  evidence comes from one study and needs replication. Processing speed has been  proposed as a substrate that may underlie the effects of executive dysfunction on  treatment response. Although processing speed does not appear to account for the  relationship between response inhibition and treatment outcome, this issue has yet  to be assessed with respect to verbal fluency. CONCLUSIONS: Verbal fluency and  response inhibition are specific aspects of executive dysfunction that appear to  impact antidepressant response rates. Disruption of the frontostriatal limbic  circuit (particularly the anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) may  explain the relation between these two mechanisms.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Depressed older adults with executive dysfunction (ED) may respond poorly to antidepressant treatment. ED is a multifaceted construct and different studies  have measured different aspects of ED, making it unclear which aspects predict poor  response. Meta-analytic methods were used to determine whether ED predicts poor  antidepressant treatment response in late-life depression and to determine which  domains of executive functioning are responsible for this relationship. METHODS: A  Medline search was conducted to identify regimented treatment trials contrasting  executive functioning between elderly responders and nonresponders; only regimented  treatment trials for depressed outpatients aged 50 and older were included.  Following the most recent PRISMA guidelines, 25 measures of executive functioning  were extracted from eight studies. Six domains were identified: cognitive  flexibility, planning and organization, response inhibition, selective attention,  verbal fluency, and the Dementia Rating Scale Initiation/Perseveration composite  score (DRS I/P). Hedge's g was calculated for each measure of executive functioning.  A three-level Bayesian hierarchical linear model (HLM) was used to estimate effect  sizes for each domain of executive functioning. RESULTS: The effect of planning and  organization was significantly different from zero (Bayesian HLM estimate of domain  effect size: 0.91; 95\% CI: 0.32-1.58), whereas cognitive flexibility, response  inhibition, selective attention, verbal fluency, and the DRS I/P composite score  were not. CONCLUSION: The domain of planning and organization is meaningfully  associated with poor antidepressant treatment response in late-life depression.  These findings suggest that therapies that focus on planning and organization may  provide effective augmentation strategies for antidepressant nonresponders with  late-life depression.},

Les bibliothèques se sont rapidement positionnées pour accompagner ce tournant numérique en ouvrant des ateliers d'initiation à l'informatique, à l'Internet puis au numérique. Dans cet ouvrage, un collectif de chercheurs (sciences de l'éducation, sciences politiques, sociologie, anthropologie, etc.) et de bibliothécaires (lecture publique notamment) revient sur l'expérience des 'ateliers internet' et analyse l'apport spécifique des bibliothèques en France et à l'étranger dans la construction d'une culture numérique. Au-delà du thème de la fracture numérique, qui imposerait une ligne de partage entre les citoyens connectés et les autres, ces auteurs indiquent que les lignes de rupture sont plurielles ; les usagers qui prennent le chemin des 'ateliers internet' cherchent tout à la fois à faire face aux injonctions sociales de la société de l'information, à acquérir des savoir-faire qu'ils considèrent comme nécessaires mais aussi à se ressaisir comme individu compétent, intégré, reconnu. Ces ateliers en bibliothèque constituent des tiers-lieux essentiels, au cœur de la cité, où peut s'opérer une transition numérique entre des façons d'apprendre, de communiquer, de travailler, de se lier à l'autre et de faire société."

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the association between physical frailty and neurocognitive performance in late-life depression (LLD). METHODS:  Cross-sectional design using baseline data from a treatment study of late-life  depression was used in this study. Individuals aged 60 years and older were  diagnosed with major depressive disorder at time of assessment (N = 173). All  participants received clinical assessment of depression and completed  neuropsychological testing during a depressive episode. Physical frailty was  assessed using an adaptation of the FRAIL scale. Neuropsychological domains were  derived from a factor analysis that yielded three factors: (i) speeded executive and  fluency, (ii) episodic memory, and (iii) working memory. Associations were examined  with bivariate tests and multivariate models. RESULTS: Depressed individuals with a  FRAIL score {$>$}1 had worse performance than nonfrail depressed across all three  factors; however, speeded executive and fluency was the only factor that remained  significant after controlling for depression symptom severity and demographic  characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Although physical frailty is associated with broad  neurocognitive deficits in LLD, it is most robustly associated with deficits in  speeded executive functions and verbal fluency. Causal inferences are limited by the  cross-sectional design, and future research would benefit from a comparison group of  nondepressed older adults with similar levels of frailty. Research is needed to  understand the mechanisms underlying associations among depression symptoms,  physical frailty, and executive dysfunction and how they are related to the  cognitive and symptomatic course of LLD.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neuropsychiatric symptoms are common in multiple sclerosis (MS). Among these, apathy is relatively frequent but its relationships with cognitive  dysfunctions have been poorly investigated. OBJECTIVE: To explore cognitive  correlates of apathy with or without depression ("pure apathy") in MS patients.  MATERIAL AND METHOD: Nondemented MS patients (n = 125), consecutively referred to  the Multiple Sclerosis Center of Moscati Hospital, in Avellino, Italy, underwent the  Apathy Evaluation Scale Self-Rated (AES-S), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale  (HDRS), and a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. RESULTS: According to  cut-off scores of AES-S (≥36), of HDRS (≥15) and criteria for diagnosis of apathy  and major depression, the sample was divided into 4 subgroups: 49 patients without  apathy or depression (A-D-), 20 patients with "pure" apathy (A+D-), 29 patients with  depression only (A-D+), and 27 patients with apathy and depression (A+D+). Cognitive  performance significantly differed in the 4 groups: in particular MS patients with  apathy (A+D- and A+D+) performed significantly worse on executive tasks than  patients without apathy, whereas patients with "pure" apathy (A+D-) performed  significantly worse than patients without apathy only on executive tasks tapping  cognitive control abilities. CONCLUSIONS: We found a significant relationship  between apathy and dysexecutive defects in MS, consistent with the hypothesis that  dysfunctions of prefrontal cortico-subcortical circuits contribute to specific  neuropsychiatric syndromes in MS patients.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Nowadays there are numerous reports stressing the occurrence of cognitive functions disorders in late-life depression (LLD). More and more  frequently the studies stress the role of executive dysfunctions in LLD. The purpose  of the study was an evaluation of the components of executive functions in  non-demented LLD patients, as well as an evaluation of the relation between the  individual components of executive functions and the level of depressiveness.  METHODS: The study included 87 persons with depression and 100 persons in the  control group. For the purpose of a screening evaluation of cognitive functions the  Mini-MentalState Examination (MMSE) was applied. For the evaluation of the level of  executive functions efficiency the following were chosen: a) Trail Making Test  (TMT), b) Verbal Fluency Tests (VFT) and c) go/no-go task (GNG). RESULTS: A  significant difference was found in the levels of efficiency of all the components  of executive functions in patients with late-life depression. The patients with  depression demonstrated the slowest psychomotor speed and worse results in the tests  evaluating cognitive flexibility, semantic fluency and inhibition. Statistically  significant relation was observed between the higher result in GDS-SF (Geriatric  Depression Scale-Short Form) and the worse performance in the GNG test. CONCLUSIONS:  The patients with depression demonstrated a significant impairment of executive  functions. A relation was found between the cognitive control disorder and the level  of depressiveness. Executive dysfunctions can play an important role in the  persistence of depressive symptoms. Identification of patients with depression and  executive dysfunctions has significant therapeutic implications.},

Seniors suffering from  depression (SSDs) on the other hand show EF-related deficiencies; however, there is  hardly any literature available regarding their relationship with FI in Latin SSDs,  who usually have low ELs. OBJECTIVE: To verify the relationship between EFs and FI  in SSDs of Latin origins, by controlling the effects associated with age and  educational level. METHODOLOGY: Cross-sectional study, of cases and controls,  conducted on a nonprobability sample, made up of 102 self-sufficient SSDs and 142  control subjects over age 50, monolinguals of Latin origin (Chileans), all assessed  by means of a battery of assessments such as: Geriatric Depression Scale,  Addenbrook's Cognitive Assessment III, Trail making Tests A and B, STROOP word-color  test, and semantic and phonological verbal fluency tests. A domain of composite EFs  was established with standardized Chilean population scores, where age and  educational levels were controlled. A simple linear regression analysis was  conducted to determine the relationship between EFs and FI in SSDs. RESULTS: Upon  controlling age and educational levels, EFs explained an FI variance of 3.9\% in  SSDs; depression explained an EF variance of 3.2\%, and 3.7\% of FI.

  abstract = {Functional impairment (FI) relates to the condition of executive functions (EFs). While EFs become affected by age and educational level (EL). Seniors suffering from  depression (SSDs) on the other hand show EF-related deficiencies; however, there is  hardly any literature available regarding their relationship with FI in Latin SSDs,  who usually have low ELs. OBJECTIVE: To verify the relationship between EFs and FI  in SSDs of Latin origins, by controlling the effects associated with age and  educational level. METHODOLOGY: Cross-sectional study, of cases and controls,  conducted on a nonprobability sample, made up of 102 self-sufficient SSDs and 142  control subjects over age 50, monolinguals of Latin origin (Chileans), all assessed  by means of a battery of assessments such as: Geriatric Depression Scale,  Addenbrook's Cognitive Assessment III, Trail making Tests A and B, STROOP word-color  test, and semantic and phonological verbal fluency tests. A domain of composite EFs  was established with standardized Chilean population scores, where age and  educational levels were controlled. A simple linear regression analysis was  conducted to determine the relationship between EFs and FI in SSDs. RESULTS: Upon  controlling age and educational levels, EFs explained an FI variance of 3.9\% in  SSDs; depression explained an EF variance of 3.2\%, and 3.7\% of FI. CONCLUSION: The  results of the present study highlight the importance of a timely intervention when  it comes to geriatric depression, considering the negative effect it has over the  executive functions and the functionality of seniors.},

  abstract = {Poor cognitive control (CC) is common among older individuals with major depressive disorder (OMDD). At the same time, studies of CC in OMDD with fMRI are relatively  limited and often have small samples. The present study was conducted to further  examine poor CC in OMDD with early onset depression, as well as to investigate the  interactive effects of MDD and aging on cognitive control. Twenty OMDD, 17 older  never-depressed comparisons (ONDC), 16 younger adults with MDD (YMDD), and 18  younger never-depressed comparisons (YNDC) participated. All participants completed  the Go level of the Parametric Go/No-Go Test, which requires sustained attention and  inhibitory control while undergoing functional MRI (fMRI). YNDC were faster in  reaction times (RTs) to go targets relative to the other 3 groups, and the YMDD  group was faster than the OMDD group. fMRI effects of both age and diagnosis were  present, with greater activation in MDD, and in aging. Additionally, the interaction  of age and MDD was also significant, such that OMDD exhibited greater recruitment of  fronto-subcortical regions relative to older comparisons. These results are  consistent with prior research reporting that OMDD recruit more fronto-striatal  regions in order to perform at the same level as their never-depressed peers, here  on a task of sustained attention and inhibitory control. There may be an interaction  of cognitive aging and depression to create a double burden on the CC network in  OMDD, including possible fronto-striatal compensation during CC that is unique to  OMDD, as younger MDD individuals do not show this pattern.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: People who attempt suicide often display cognitive impairments, particularly poor cognitive control. Could poor cognitive control contribute to high  suicide rates in old age? A component of cognitive control, cognitive  inhibition-active suppression of task-irrelevant processing-is very sensitive to  aging and has been linked to attempted suicide. We investigated cognitive inhibition  in older high-lethality suicide attempters, closely resembling suicide victims, as  well as low-lethality attempters, and control groups with and without depression and  suicidal ideation. METHODS: A total of 102 participants aged 60\,years and older (17  psychiatrically healthy control subjects, 38 depressed control subjects, 16 suicide  ideators, 14 low-lethality suicide attempters, and 17 high-lethality suicide  attempters) underwent comprehensive clinical and cognitive assessments. They  completed the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System Color-Word Interference Test, a  validated modification of the Stroop test. RESULTS: High-lethality suicide  attempters demonstrated a distinct pattern of cognitive inhibition deficits.  Compared with psychiatrically healthy control subjects and suicide ideators,  high-lethality attempters took longer to complete inhibition trials, even after  accounting for potential confounding factors (age, education, Mini mental state  examination score, information processing speed, and accuracy). Compared with  non-suicidal depressed and healthy control subjects, low-lethality suicide  attempters committed more uncorrected errors; however, this difference was not  specific to the inhibition condition. CONCLUSIONS: Older suicide attempters are a  cognitively heterogeneous group. Poor cognitive control in high-lethality attempters  may undermine their ability to solve real-life problems, precipitating a  catastrophic accumulation of stressors. Meanwhile, low-lethality attempters' poor  performance may reflect a careless approach to the task or faulty monitoring.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: a comprehensive literature review suggests that suicidal behaviour results from a complex interplay between stressful events and vulnerability factors  including cognitive deficits. The aim of this systematic literature review was to  identify the neurocognitive markers associated with suicide vulnerability in elderly  people. METHOD: a systematic English Medline literature search of cohort studies,  case-control studies and cross-sectional studies published between January 1960 and  December 2012 was performed, combining the MeSH terms "Suicide", "Neuropsychology",  "Neuropsychological Tests", "Executive Function", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging",  "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Prefrontal  Cortex", "Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon", and "Diffusion Tensor  Imaging". The abstract selection was based on the Strobe checklist for observational  studies. RESULTS: of the 446 original articles, 10 neuropsychological and 4 brain  imaging studies were selected. The number of suicidal subjects ranged from 10 to 29  (mean age=66.8 to 79.1 years old, 0-85\% women). Executive functions, in particular  decision-making and cognitive inhibition, were more impaired in the depressed  elderly with a history of suicide attempts compared to those without such a history.  fMRI data, which need to be confirmed in further details, showed abnormalities of  fronto-limbic circuits which are involved in suicide vulnerability in the elderly  independently of any associated psychopathological conditions including depression.  CONCLUSION: this literature review confirms the existence of neurocognitive markers  of suicide vulnerability in elderly people. A neuropsychological assessment could  thus help to identify the suicide vulnerability of a depressed elderly person, a  first step for both pharmacological and psychotherapeutic cares.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Late-life depression is associated with cognitive deficits and increased risk for cognitive decline. The purpose of the study was to determine whether  clinical characteristics could serve as phenotypes informative of subsequent  cognitive decline. Age at depression onset and antidepressant remission at 3 months  (acute response) and 12 months (chronic response) were examined. METHODS: In a  longitudinal study of late-life depression in an academic center, 273 depressed and  164 never-depressed community-dwelling elders aged 60 years or older were followed  on average for over 5 years. Participants completed annual neuropsychological  testing. Neuropsychological measures were converted to z-scores derived from the  baseline performance of all participants. Cognitive domain scores at each time were  then created by averaging z-scores across tests, grouped into domains of episodic  memory, attention-working memory, verbal fluency, and executive function. RESULTS:  Depressed participants exhibited poorer performance at baseline and greater  subsequent decline in all domains. Early-onset depressed individuals exhibited a  greater decline in all domains than late-onset or nondepressed groups. For  remission, remitters and nonremitters at both 3 and 12 month exhibited greater  decline in episodic memory and attention-working memory than nondepressed subjects.  Three-month remitters also exhibited a greater decline in verbal fluency and  executive function, whereas 12-month nonremitters exhibited greater decline in  executive function than other groups. CONCLUSION: Consistent with past studies,  depressed elders exhibit greater cognitive decline than nondepressed subjects,  particularly individuals with early depression onset, supporting the theory that  repeated depressive episodes may contribute to decline. Clinical remission is not  associated with less cognitive decline.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with impaired attention control and alterations in frontal-subcortical connectivity. We hypothesized that  attention control as assessed by Stroop task interference depends on white matter  integrity in fronto-cingulate regions and assessed this relationship using diffusion  tensor imaging (DTI) in MDD and healthy volunteers (HV). METHODS: DTI images and  Stroop task were acquired in 29 unmedicated MDD patients and 16 HVs, aged 18-65  years. The relationship between Stroop interference and fractional anisotropy (FA)  was examined using region-of-interest (ROI) and tract-based spatial statistics  (TBSS) analyses. RESULTS: ROI analysis revealed that Stroop interference correlated  positively with FA in left caudal anterior cingulate cortex (cACC) in HVs (r = 0.62,  p = 0.01), but not in MDD (r = -0.05, p= 0.79) even after controlling for depression  severity. The left cACC was among 4 ROIs in fronto-cingulate network where FA was  lower in MDD relative to HVs (F((1,41)) = 8.87, p = 0.005). Additionally, TBSS  showed the same group interaction of differences and correlations, although only at  a statistical trend level. LIMITATIONS: The modest sample size limits the  generalizability of the findings. CONCLUSIONS: Structural connectivity of white  matter network of cACC correlated with magnitude of Stroop interference in HVs, but  not MDD. The cACC-frontal network, sub-serving attention control, may be disrupted  in MDD. Less cognitive control may include enhanced effects of salience in HVs, or  less effective response inhibition in MDD. Further studies of salience and  inhibition components of executive function may better elucidate the relationship  between brain white matter changes and executive dysfunction in MDD.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that individuals with mood disorders have a higher prevalence of both hypercortisolemia and insulin resistance. Insulin  resistance is posited to contribute to the cognitive deficits observed in  individuals who have depression. However, the mechanistic relationship between  cortisol and insulin within the central nervous system remains to be further  elucidated. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the antiglucocorticoid  agent, mifepristone, on metabolic function and cognitive performance in individuals  receiving treatment for depressive disorders who were euthymic at baseline. METHODS:  Participants were administered a 600\,mg/day dose of mifepristone for 28 days. Oral  glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) and cognitive assessments measuring verbal memory  and executive functioning were administered at baseline and after 28 days of  treatment. RESULTS: Improvements in attention and verbal learning were associated  with reduction of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in response to mifepristone  treatment. LIMITATIONS: Limitations include the open-label design of this study and  a small sample size. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study suggest that  improvement in fasting plasma glucose levels, upon administration of mifepristone,  is associated with the improvement in early input of verbal information. Further  studies are warranted in order to better evaluate the use of mifepristone or other  antiglucocorticoid agents in treatment of mood disorders characterized by metabolic  dysfunction.},

  abstract = {Plant beneficial microbes (PBMs), such as plant growth-promoting bacteria, rhizobia, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and Trichoderma, can reduce the use of agrochemicals and increase plant yield, nutrition, and tolerance to biotic-abiotic stresses. Yet, large-scale applications of PBM have been hampered by the high amounts of inoculum per plant or per cultivation area needed for successful colonization and consequently the economic feasibility. Seed coating, a process that consists in covering seeds with low amounts of exogenous materials, is gaining attention as an efficient delivery system for PBM. Microbial seed coating comprises the use of a binder, in some cases a filler, mixed with inocula, and can be done using simple mixing equipment (e.g., cement mixer) or more specialized/sophisticated apparatus (e.g., fluidized bed). Binders/fillers can be used to extend microbial survival. The most reported types of seed coating are seed dressing, film coating, and pelleting. Tested in more than 50 plant species with seeds of different dimensions, forms, textures, and germination types (e.g., cereals, vegetables, fruits, pulses, and other legumes), seed coating has been studied using various species of plant growth-promoting bacteria, rhizobia, Trichoderma, and to a lesser extent mycorrhizal fungi. Most of the studies regarding PBM applied via seed coating are aimed at promoting crop growth, yield, and crop protection against pathogens. Studies have shown that coating seeds with PBM can assist crops in improving seedling establishment and germination or achieving high yields and food quality, under reduced chemical fertilization. The right combination of biological control agents applied via seed coating can be a powerful tool against a wide number of diseases and pathogens. Less frequently, studies report seed coating being used for adaptation and protection of crops under abiotic stresses. Notwithstanding the promising results, there are still challenges mainly related with the scaling up from the laboratory to the field and proper formulation, including efficient microbial combinations and coating materials that can result in extended shelf-life of both seeds and coated PBM. These limitations need to be addressed and overcome in order to allow a wider use of seed coating as a cost-effective delivery method for PBM in sustainable agricultural systems.},

The primary goal of the present study was to evaluate whether apathy and  depression have unique influences on degree of functional impairment, independent of  the effects of specific cognitive impairments. Participants included 344 older  adults (199 normal, 87 with MCI, 58 with dementia). The Everyday Cognition (ECog)  scales were used to measure both global and domain-specific functional abilities.  Neuropsychiatric symptoms of depression and apathy were measured by the  Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and specific neuropsychological domains measured  included episodic memory and executive functioning. Results indicated that worse  memory and executive function, as well as greater depression and apathy, were all  independent and additive determinants of poorer functional abilities. Apathy had a  slightly more restricted effect than the other variables across the specific  functional domains assessed. Secondary analysis suggested that neuropsychiatric  symptoms may be more strongly associated with everyday function within cognitively  normal and MCI groups, while cognitive impairment is more strongly associated with  everyday function in dementia. Thus, a somewhat different set of factors may be  associated with functional status across various clinical groups.},

Methods             Published and preprint randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing IVM effects on COVID-19 adult patients were searched until March 15, 2021 in five engines. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, length of stay (LOS), and adverse events (AE). Secondary outcomes included viral clearance and severe AEs. We evaluated risk of bias (RoB) using the Cochrane RoB 2·0 tool. Inverse variance random effect meta-analyses were performed with quality of evidence (QoE) evaluated using GRADE methodology. Subgroup analyses by severity of disease and RoB, and sensitivity analyses by time of follow-up were conducted.                                   Results             Ten RCTs (n=1173) were included. Controls were standard of care [SOC] in five RCTs and placebo in five RCTs. RCTs sample size ranged from 24 to 398 patients, mean age from 26 to 56 years-old, and severity of COVID-19 disease was mild in 8 RCTs, moderate in one RCT, and mild and moderate in one RCT. IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality vs. controls (RR 0.37, 95\%CI 0.12 to 1.13, very low QoE). IVM did not reduce LOS vs. controls (MD 0.72 days, 95\%CI -0.86 to 2.29, very low QoE). AEs, severe AE and viral clearance were similar between IVM and controls (low QoE for these three outcomes). Subgroups by severity of COVID-19 or RoB were mostly consistent with main analyses; all-cause mortality in three RCTs at high RoB was reduced with IVM. Sensitivity analyses excluding RCTs with follow up {$<$}21 days showed no difference in all-cause mortality.                                   Conclusions             In comparison to SOC or placebo, IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality, length of stay or viral clearance in RCTs in COVID-19 patients with mostly mild disease. IVM did not have effect on AEs or SAEs. IVM is not a viable option to treat COVID-19 patients.},

To pilot test the efficacy of the game, we conducted a randomized field study (N = 95) in a public high school setting. Results provide some preliminary evidence that playing the fake news game reduced the perceived reliability and persuasiveness of fake news articles. Overall, these findings suggest that educational games may be a promising vehicle to inoculate the public against fake news.},

The game draws on an inoculation metaphor, where preemptively exposing, warning, and familiarising people with the strategies used in the production of fake news helps confer cognitive immunity when exposed to real misinformation. We conducted a large-scale evaluation of the game with N\,=\,15,000 participants in a pre-post gameplay design.

Providing reliable resources with minimal barriers to access involves cooperation among librarians, publishers, and vendors; however, I suggest that there is tension between our mutual desires to satisfy student demands for instant and perfect results and to encourage them to become persistent and critical information seekers. Many tools exist to assist students in gaining background information and limiting search results, but ultimately none replace the need to develop and explore questions and to evaluate information sources. In this paper, I reflect on the difficulties of persuading students to persist in using library resources and the use of Bernard Lonergan’s generalized empirical method as a framework for critical thinking and information literacy.},

High consumption of Allura Red has claimed an adverse effects of human health including allergies, food intolerance, cancer, multiple sclerosis, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, brain damage, nausea, cardiac disease and asthma due to the reaction of aromatic azo compounds (R = R' = aromatic). Several countries have banned and strictly controlled the uses of Allura Red in food and beverage products. This review paper is critically summarized on the available analytical and advanced methods for determination of Allura Red and also concisely discussed on the acceptable daily intake, toxicology and extraction methods.},

  abstract = {Tartrazine is an azo food dye, which is orange-colored and water soluble. It is usually used in foods, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and textiles. Tartrazine has the potential to cause an adverse health effect on humans, such as hyperactivity in children, allergy, and asthma. Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additive and EU Scientific Committee for Food have standardized the acceptable daily intake for tartrazine that is 7.5 mg kg(-1) body weight. Many researchers have detected the presence of tartrazine for monitoring the quality and safety of food products. In this review paper, we highlighted various tartrazine detection and extraction methods. Some of the analytical methods are available such as high-performance liquid chromatography, electrochemical sensor, thin-layer chromatography, spectrophotometry, capillary electrophoresis, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Also, we discuss following extraction steps: liquid-liquid extraction, solid-phase extraction, membrane filtration, cloud point extraction, and other extraction method. In addition, a brief overview is presented explaining the synthesis process and metabolism of tartrazine and the maximum permitted level in different countries. This review paper will give an insight into different extraction and analytical methods for the determination of tartrazine in healthy foods, which will attract the attention of public toward food safety and quality, and also the interest of food industry and government bodies.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Depression in non-demented persons has been identified as a possible risk factor for incident Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Latent Growth Curve models  were developed of baseline depressive symptoms as a predictor of longitudinal  changes in cognition. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 15-item Geriatric  Depression Scale (GDS). Memory was assessed by the California Verbal Learning Task  (CVLT). Executive control function (ECF) was assessed by the Executive Interview  (EXIT25) and Trail-Making Test Part B (Trails-B). Five hundred forty-seven  non-institutionalized older retirees living in a single comprehensive care  retirement community participated. RESULTS: Depressive symptoms were significantly  associated only with the 3-year rate of decline in psychomotor speed, as measured by  Trails A, and ECF, as measured by the EXIT25. Both associations withstood adjustment  for age, gender, education, and baseline level of care. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive  symptoms are associated with longitudinal decline in cognition. However, this  association selectively involves executive control, not memory, and possibly only a  subset of 'executive' functions. Although depressive symptoms may hasten conversion  from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia, depression-related conversion is  not likely to be mediated by evolution of the AD pathological process.},

  abstract = {Major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder share symptoms that may reflect core mood disorder features. This has led to the pursuit of intermediate phenotypes and a  dimensional approach to understand neurobiological disruptions in mood disorders.  Executive dysfunction, including cognitive control, may represent a promising  intermediate phenotype across major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. This  study examined dimensions of cognitive control in women with major depressive  disorder or bipolar disorder in comparison to healthy control subjects using two  separate, consecutive experiments. For Experiment 1, participants completed a  behavioural cognitive control task (healthy controls = 150, major depressive  disorder = 260, bipolar disorder = 202; age range 17-84 years). A sample of those  participants (healthy controls = 17, major depressive disorder = 19, and bipolar  disorder = 16) completed a similar cognitive control task in an event-related design  functional magnetic resonance imaging protocol for Experiment 2. Results for  Experiment 1 showed greater impairments on the cognitive control task in patients  with mood disorders relative to healthy controls (P {$<$} 0.001), with more of those in  the mood disorder group falling into the 'impaired' range when using clinical  cut-offs ({$<$}5th percentile). Experiment 2 revealed only a few areas of shared  activation differences in mood disorder greater than healthy controls. Activation  analyses using performance as a regressor, irrespective of diagnosis, revealed  within and extra-network areas that were more active in poor performers. In summary,  performance and activation during cognitive control tasks may represent an  intermediate phenotype for mood disorders. However, cognitive control dysfunction is  not uniform across women with mood disorders, and activation is linked to  performance more so than disease. These findings support subtype and dimensional  approaches to understanding risk and expression of mood disorders and are a  promising area of inquiry, in line with the Research Domain Criteria initiative of  NIMH.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is the most effective treatment for drug-resistant depression (DRD). Because a single infusion of ketamine may exert  both a rapid antidepressant effect and a quick improvement of cognition, the aim of  the present study was to assess whether ketamine, as an anesthetic drug for ECT, can  augment the antidepressant activity of the procedure and/or exert a beneficial  effect on cognition. METHODS: A total of 11 male and 34 female patients with DRD,  aged 21 to 75 years, were included in the study. Fifteen patients (group 1) received  only thiopental anesthesia, 15 patients (group 2) had their second and third ECT  sessions with ketamine, and 15 patients (group 3) had ketamine for the second,  fourth, sixth, eighth, and tenth sessions. Depression intensity was measured by the  17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Cognitive functions were measured before  and after ECT, assessing visual-spatial abilities, verbal auditory memory, working  memory, and executive functions. RESULTS: Before the ECT, the mean (SD) intensity of  depression was 32 (6) points on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the mean  number of ECT sessions was 10.8 (1.5), with no difference between groups. After the  last ECT session, the intensity of depression was significantly lower in group 3,  compared with group 1. Cognitive assessments after ECT showed a more marked  worsening in verbal memory in patients with added ketamine anesthesia. CONCLUSIONS:  The addition of ketamine may be connected with better antidepressant efficacy of  ECT, compared with only thiopental anesthesia. However, patients with added ketamine  had worse results on some of the indices measuring verbal memory.},

Nous nous mettons alors à espérer un monde plus juste qui adviendrait grâce au retour de l’État providence, à la prise en compte des questions écologiques et à une participation citoyenne accrue. Un véritable paysage de carte postale en somme. Or, rien de cela ne nous sauvera du pouvoir des algorithmes, de la marchandisation intégrale de nos vies par l’industrie numérique, ou du déploiement d’une télésocialité contribuant à notre « isolement collectif ». Autant de processus qui engendrent de nouveaux types d’assujettissement, ignorés de la « grande politique ». Si nous savons que l’enjeu majeur de notre époque est d’être partie prenante des affaires qui nous regardent, cette aspiration prend des formes trop éparses, ne répondant à aucun projet commun défini en ce sens. À contre-courant de cette tendance, ce livre renouvelle les perspectives d’émancipation, en dressant un registre d’actions concrètes. Cela suppose de mener une critique des discours défendant des intérêts privés, de ne plus subir de situations iniques et de constituer un foisonnement de collectifs – dans tous les domaines de la vie – favorisant l’expérimentation, la meilleure expression de chacun, tout en étant soucieux de ne léser ni personne, ni la biosphère. Après tant de désillusions, le moment est venu de ne plus nous en remettre à des instances tierces pour nous engager dans une impérieuse et salutaire politique de nous-mêmes. (4e de couverture)},

In the 1980s full ingredient declarations had to be provided on food products for the first time and manufacturers were permitted to use either the name or the number of the additive on the ingredient list. This paper outlines some of the trends in the sourcing, use and labelling of additives since the introduction of full ingredient listing. Generally, sourcing has become more global with a large number of suppliers being based in China. From an initial use of E numbers in ingredient lists, manufacturers are increasingly using the names of additives. This trend is being extended to avoid the use of anything the consumer might consider an additive, particularly in connection with colours and preservatives. Specifically, the colours used in the Southampton study on the impact of food colours on hyperactivity in children have largely been replaced by colouring foodstuffs, and the preservative used in the study, sodium benzoate, has been replaced by potassium sorbate in the majority of soft drinks.

  abstract = {We add richness and depth to investor decision-making research by exploring the influence of entrepreneurs' use of ingratiation rhetoric in their investor pitch presentations on investor funding decisions. Drawing on ingratiation theory, we model the effects of flattery, self-deprecation, opinion conformity, and self-promotion as distinct forms of ingratiation rhetoric. We do so independently and in tandem, conceptualizing the confluence of ingratiation forms as driving an overall aggregate effect on the amount of funding allocated by investors. We then theorize that entrepreneur charisma and entrepreneur performance are moderators of the aggregate effect. We test our model in the angel investment context with data from 789 entrepreneur pitch presentations to 27 investors on the Shark Tank television program from 2009 through 2020. We find that on their own, the different forms of ingratiation rhetoric have mixed effects, with flattery and self-deprecation negatively impacting investor funding amount and opinion conformity and self-promotion positively relating to funding amount. When used together, we find an overall negative effect, and this effect is positively moderated by entrepreneur charisma and entrepreneur performance. These findings shed new light on ingratiation rhetoric as a powerful force in entrepreneurs' efforts to secure funding.},

Among them, we explored the usefulness of the Percentage of Papers by the Most Prolific author (PPMP) and the Gini index (level of inequality in the distribution of authorship among authors) as tools to identify journals that may show favoritism in accepting articles by specific authors. We examined whether the PPMP, complemented by the Gini index, could be useful for identifying cases of potential editorial bias, using all articles in a sample of 5,468 biomedical journals indexed in the National Library of Medicine. For articles published between 2015 and 2019, the median PPMP was 2.9\%, and 5\% of journal exhibited a PPMP of 10.6\% or more. Among the journals with the highest PPMP or Gini index values, where a few authors were responsible for a disproportionate number of publications, a random sample was manually examined, revealing that the most prolific author was part of the editorial board in 60 cases (61\%). The papers by the most prolific authors were more likely to be accepted for publication within 3 weeks of their submission. Results of analysis on a subset of articles, excluding nonresearch articles, were consistent with those of the principal analysis. In most journals, publications are distributed across a large number of authors. Our results reveal a subset of journals where a few authors, often members of the editorial board, were responsible for a disproportionate number of publications. To enhance trust in their practices, journals need to be transparent about their editorial and peer review practices.},

  abstract = {This surprising study of online political mobilization shows that money and organizational sophistication influence politics online as much as off, and casts doubt on the democratizing power of digital activism.The internet has been hailed as a leveling force that is reshaping activism. From the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street to Black Lives Matter and \#MeToo, digital activism seemed cheap, fast, and open to all. Now this celebratory narrative finds itself competing with an increasingly sinister story as platforms like Facebook and Twitter―once the darlings of digital democracy―are on the defensive for their role in promoting fake news. While hashtag activism captures headlines, conservative digital activism is proving more effective on the ground.In this sharp-eyed and counterintuitive study, Jen Schradie shows how the web has become another weapon in the arsenal of the powerful. She zeroes in on workers’ rights advocacy in North Carolina and finds a case study with broad implications. North Carolina’s hard-right turn in the early 2010s should have alerted political analysts to the web’s antidemocratic potential: amid booming online organizing, one of the country’s most closely contested states elected the most conservative government in North Carolina’s history.The Revolution That Wasn’t identifies the reasons behind this previously undiagnosed digital-activism gap. Large hierarchical political organizations with professional staff can amplify their digital impact, while horizontally organized volunteer groups tend to be less effective at translating online goodwill into meaningful action. Not only does technology fail to level the playing field, it tilts it further, so that only the most sophisticated and well-funded players can compete.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with impairments in several cognitive domains. People with depression also tend to focus on and think  about their problems ("ruminate") more than people without depression. Recent  studies indicate that depressive rumination is connected to cognitive impairments in  MDD. However, there is little scientific understanding of the role of rumination in  these deficits. SAMPLING AND METHODS: The current study examined the performance of  62 outpatients suffering from unipolar major depression with a low tendency to  ruminate versus outpatients with a high tendency to ruminate using a  neuropsychological battery covering the 5 cognitive domains: attention, memory,  working memory, executive functions and processing speed. RESULTS: The results  indicated that high ruminators show a lower performance than low ruminators with  regard to processing speed and executive function tasks with low effect sizes.  However, these findings were not significant after Bonferroni correction.  Hierarchical linear regression revealed that the effect on processing speed could be  partially attributed to rumination, but an effect on executive functions was not  established. CONCLUSIONS: The current study is the first to systematically  investigate the impact of rumination on cognitive impairments in MDD, exploring a  broad range of cognitive domains. The results partially support the hypothesis that  rumination has an impact on single cognitive domains and highlight the necessity for  further investigations in order to generalize these findings.},

  abstract = {Introduction: It is widely accepted that major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with impairments in several cognitive domains in inpatients, but  cognitive functioning has barely been systematically investigated in depressed  outpatients. The aims of the present study were to examine cognitive functioning in  depressed outpatients in comparison with healthy controls and to determine whether  cognitive deficits vary as a function of different disorder characteristics and  demographic variables. Method: We compared 103 outpatients with recurrent MDD in an  acute phase of the illness with 103 healthy controls matched on age, gender, and  education level using a neuropsychological battery covering the domains of  processing speed, attention, memory, working memory, and executive functions.  Results: Depressed outpatients were found to be impaired in all five assessed  cognitive domains. These impairments varied as a function of the disorder  characteristics, particularly severity of depression, intake of medication, age of  depression onset, duration of current episode, and rumination as a psychological  variable as well as age, premorbid intelligence, and education level as demographic  variables. Conclusions: In the present study we tried to systematically investigate  the impact of different disorder characteristics and demographic variables on the  cognitive dysfunction of outpatients with MDD. The results indicate a moderate to  severe cognitive impairment of outpatients with MDD and reveal an influence of  different disease characteristics as well as demographics. These cognitive  impairments may affect the course of the disease and should be considered in  outpatient therapy.},

Rarely omissions and distortions of memory are researched with tasks  resembling everyday life. We investigated healthy older control subjects (HC) and  patients with depressive disorder (DD). Cognitive function was assessed with a  comprehensive neuropsychological test battery and mood with the Montgomery-Asberg  Depression Scale (MADRS). We assessed everyday veridical and distorted memories on  showing participants original news and commercials. In most aspects of attention,  executive functions, and memory, patients with DD performed worse than HC. Regarding  memory content on viewing news or commercials the difference between patients with  DD and HC was more pronounced for false memory content than for veridical memory  content. Linear regression analysis showed the extent of false memory content being  associated with mental flexibility as assessed with the Trail Making Test and mood  as assessed with the MADRS for both information obtained on viewing news and  commercials. Increase of false memories impedes overall accuracy of memory more than  decrease of veridical memories in older persons with depressive disorder. Diminished  executive functions and depressive mood partly explain these memory distortions.},

  abstract = {Objective and subjective cognitive measures are altered in major depressive disorder (MDD), but there is a poor correlation between them. This study aims to explore such  discrepancy and the characteristics explaining this phenomenon. 229 patients with  MDD subdivided into remitted (n\,=\,57), partially remitted (n\,=\,90) and acute  (n\,=\,82) underwent a clinical interview, completed self-report questionnaires and a  neuropsychological assessment. The association between objective and subjective  cognition was evaluated in the areas of attention and memory. Also, dependent  measures of concordance and self-appraisal were calculated for each patient.  Potential predictors of these outcomes were evaluated through regression analysis.  Depressive symptoms correlated negatively with objective but especially with  subjective cognition. Patients in an acute episode showed a significant correlation  between objective and subjective attention/memory measures, but also the greatest  underestimation of their cognitive performance. In those with fewer depressive  symptoms, objective and subjective cognition showed poor correspondence between  them. In the regression analyses with the full MDD sample, higher scores on  depressive symptoms, intelligence quotient and executive functions predicted lower  self-appraisal. Objective and subjective cognition show poor concordance in MDD  patients, especially in those with residual mood symptoms. Higher executive  functions also explain this discrepancy. Assessments of both subjective cognitive  complaints and objective performance seem necessary as they may be measuring  different aspects of cognitive functioning.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neuropsychological impairment is a key feature of late-life depression, with deficits observed across multiple domains. However, it is unclear whether  deficits in multiple domains represent relatively independent processes with  specific neural correlates or whether they can be explained by cognitive deficits in  executive function or processing speed. METHOD: We examined group differences across  five domains (episodic memory; executive function; language skills; processing  speed; visuospatial skills) in a sample of 36 depressed participants and 25 control  participants, all aged ≥ 60 years. The influence of executive function and  processing speed deficits on other neuropsychological domains was also investigated.  Magnetic resonance imaging correlates of executive function, processing speed and  episodic memory were explored in the late-life depression group. RESULTS: Relative  to controls, the late-life depression group performed significantly worse in the  domains of executive function, processing speed, episodic memory and language  skills. Impairments in executive function or processing speed were sufficient to  explain differences in episodic memory and language skills. Executive function was  correlated with anisotropy of the anterior thalamic radiation and uncinate  fasciculus; processing speed was correlated with anisotropy of genu of the corpus  callosum. Episodic memory was correlated with anisotropy of the anterior thalamic  radiation, the genu and body of the corpus callosum and the fornix. CONCLUSIONS:  Executive function and processing speed appear to represent important cognitive  deficits in late-life depression, which contribute to deficits in other domains, and  are related to reductions in anisotropy in frontal tracts.},

  abstract = {Clinical trials have demonstrated the benefits of ibuprofen therapy in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, an effect that is currently attributed to ibuprofen's anti-inflammatory properties. Yet, a few previous reports demonstrated an antimicrobial activity of ibuprofen as well, although none investigated its direct effects on the pathogens found in the CF lung, which is the focus of this work. Determination of ibuprofen's in vitro antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia species strains through measurements of the endpoint number of CFU and growth kinetics showed that ibuprofen reduced the growth rate and bacterial burden of the tested strains in a dose-dependent fashion. In an in vitroPseudomonas biofilm model, a reduction in the rate of biomass accumulation over 8 h of growth with ibuprofen treatment was observed. Next, an acute Pseudomonas pneumonia model was used to test this antimicrobial activity after the oral delivery of ibuprofen. Following intranasal inoculation, ibuprofen-treated mice exhibited lower CFU counts and improved survival compared with the control animals. Preliminary biodistribution studies performed after the delivery of ibuprofen to mice by aerosol demonstrated a rapid accumulation of ibuprofen in serum and minimum retention in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Therefore, ibuprofen-encapsulated polymeric nanoparticles (Ibu-NPs) were formulated to improve the pharmacokinetic profile. Ibu-NPs formulated for aerosol delivery inhibited the growth of P. aeruginosa in vitro and may provide a convenient dosing method. These results provide an additional explanation for the previously observed therapeutic effects of ibuprofen in CF patients and further strengthen the argument for its use by these patients.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Research on vascular depression has used 2 approaches to subtype late-life depression, based on executive dysfunction or white matter hyperintensity severity.  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship of neuropsychological performance and white  matter hyperintensity with clinical response in late-life depression. DESIGN:  Two-site, prospective, nonrandomized controlled trial. SETTING: Outpatient clinics  at Washington University and Duke University. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 217 subjects  aged 60 years or older met DSM-IV criteria for major depression, scored 20 or more  on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and received vascular risk  factor scores, neuropsychological testing, and magnetic resonance imaging; they were  excluded for cognitive impairment or severe medical disorders. Fazekas rating was  conducted to grade white matter hyperintensity lesions. Intervention Twelve weeks of  sertraline treatment, titrated by clinical response. Main Outcome Measure  Participants' MADRS scores over time. RESULTS: Baseline neuropsychological factor  scores correlated negatively with baseline Fazekas scores. A mixed model examined  effects of predictor variables on MADRS scores over time. Baseline episodic memory  (P = .002), language (P = .007), working memory (P = .01), processing speed (P {$<$}  .001), executive function factor scores (P = .002), and categorical Fazekas ratings  (P = .05) predicted MADRS scores, controlling for age, education, age of onset, and  race. Controlling for baseline MADRS scores, these factors remained significant  predictors of decrease in MADRS scores, except for working memory and Fazekas  ratings. Thirty-three percent of subjects achieved remission (MADRS {$<$} or =7).  Remitters differed from nonremitters in baseline cognitive processing speed,  executive function, language, episodic memory, and vascular risk factor scores.  CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive neuropsychological function and white matter  hyperintensity severity predicted MADRS scores prospectively over a 12-week  treatment course with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in late-life  depression. Baseline neuropsychological function differentiated remitters from  nonremitters and predicted time to remission in a proportional hazards model.  Predictor variables correlated highly with vascular risk factor severity. These data  support the vascular depression hypothesis and highlight the importance of linking  subtypes based on neuropsychological function and white matter integrity.

We investigated the  relationships between depressive symptoms or depression, cognitive function, serum  brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and volumetric MRI measurements in older  adults. A total of 4352 individuals aged 65 years or older (mean age 72 years)  participated in the study. We investigated medical history and geriatric depression  scale-15 (GDS-15) items to determine depression and depressive symptoms. Cognitive  tests included the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), story memory, word list  memory, trail-making tests, and the symbol digit substitution task. Of the 4352  participants, 570 (13\%) fulfilled the criteria for depressive symptoms (GDS-15:  6~+~points) and 87 (2\%) were diagnosed with depression. All cognitive tests showed  significant differences between the 'no depressive symptoms', 'depressive symptoms',  and 'depression' groups. The 'depressive symptoms' and 'depression' groups showed  lower serum BDNF (p~{$<~$}0.001) concentrations than the 'no depressive symptoms' group.  The 'depressive symptoms' group exhibited greater atrophy of the right medial  temporal lobe than did the 'no depressive symptoms' group (p~=~0.023). These results  suggest that memory, executive function, and processing speed examinations are  useful to identify cognitive decline in older adults who have depressive symptoms  and depression. Serum BDNF concentration and atrophy of the right medial temporal  lobe may in part mediate the relationships between depressive symptoms and cognitive  decline.},

METHOD: Neuropsychological  functioning in patients with a medication refractory depressive episode, that were  treated with a course of BF ultra-brief ECT at 1.5 times seizure threshold (ST) or  UL ultra-brief ECT at 6 times ST, by random assignment, was assessed before  treatment, and 1 and 6 weeks after the treatment course, by a blinded rater.  RESULTS: Of the 64 patients that were included, 32 (50\%) received BF ECT, and 32  (50\%) received UL ECT, by random assignment. Neuropsychological testing 1 and 6  weeks after treatment was performed by 30 (93.75\%) and 19 (59.37\%) patients,  respectively, in the BF-group and 29 (90.62\%) and 20 (62.50\%), respectively, in the  UL-group. There was no deterioration in any of the neuropsychological measures.  Patients rated their memory as clearly improved after treatment. There were no  significant differences between the patients given BF ECT and those given UL ECT.  CONCLUSIONS: Ultrabrief pulse ECT, used either in combination with a UL electrode  position and a stimulus of 6 times ST, or a BF electrode position with a stimulus of  1.5 times ST, are effective antidepressant techniques, that do not have a  deleterious effect on cognitive function.},

In this cross-sectional study, 55  patients with biochemically confirmed acromegaly were enrolled. MRI data were  compared with 87 control subjects. Main outcome measures were performance levels in  13 cognitive tests covering the domains of attention, memory and executive function,  with performance below the cut-off level of the 16th percentile rated as impaired.  In addition, individual global and hippocampal volume changes were defined for each  patient in reference to a normative sample. We found that up to 33.3\% of the  patients were impaired in the attention, up to 24.1\% in the memory, and up to 16.7\%  in the executive function domain. 67.3\% of the patients failed to reach the cut-off  level in at least one subtest. MRI demonstrated increased global, left and right  hippocampal grey matter and white matter, particularly early in the disease course.  Rather few positive than expected negative correlations could be established between  the hippocampal grey matter gain and cognitive performance. Cognitive dysfunction,  particularly attentional deficits, are common in acromegaly, rendering  neuropsychological testing essential in the diagnostic work-up.},

A second aim was to investigate if pre-treatment cognitive  flexibility and self-reported cognitive problems would predict outcome. We included  66 older adults (aged over 60 years) with mixed anxiety/depression following media  recruitment and randomised them into treatment and control groups. We also included  a one-year follow-up. As a measure of executive function, we used the Wisconsin Card  Sorting Test (perseverative errors) and the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire during  the pre-treatment phase. Results showed a moderate between-group effect on the main  outcome measure, the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) (d= .50), favouring the treatment  group. Nearly half (45.5\%) of that group were classified as responders. One person  (3\%) in the treatment group deteriorated. There were significant correlations  between perseverative errors and outcome (on the BAI r = -.45), but not among  self-reported cognitive function. We conclude that guided, tailored ICBT may be  effective for some older adults and that the role of cognitive function needs to be  investigated further.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs) in improving depressive symptoms, disability,  and cognition in older adults with depression and cognitive deficits. DESIGN: It was  performed a systematic search for articles published between 1994 and February 2014  in the MEDLINE/Pubmed, PsycINFO, and SCIELO. The studies should have provided  information about benefits after CBTs to older adults with depression and cognitive  deficits. RESULTS: Cognitive behavioral therapy focused on problem solving is the  main approach studied, having better effectiveness than supportive therapy in  randomized clinical trials. Significant improvements in mood and disability were  consistent, although evidence of changes in cognitive measures is controversial,  less studied, and limited. Nevertheless, improvements in executive functions,  processing speed, and changes in patients' perspectives of problem solving skills,  such as generating alternatives and decision-making, were described. Also, it would  be necessary that future studies more often evaluate cognitive status of depressed  elders, as well as cognitive changes after psychotherapy. It should be emphasized  that there is a lack of studies in this field, and more approaches in CBTs need to  be investigated to this population. CONCLUSION: Older adults with depression and  cognitive deficits can benefit from CBTs. Improvements in mood and disability are  more consistent than changes in cognition, which are little studied after CBTs. It  is necessary more studies in the field, as well as, to investigate more approaches  in CBTs to older adults with depression and cognitive deficits.},

  abstract = {In debates over diagnoses of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and use of the drug Ritalin among the American school age population, discussion often centers around who is to blame for rising diagnoses and increasing use of Ritalin. Parents have come under particular scrutiny by critics who associate ADHD behaviors in children with poor parenting and view Ritalin as a “quick-fix” for socially situated problems. Biologically oriented researchers of ADHD, on the other hand have posited organically based dysfunction as the cause of ADHD behaviors. This paper explores the problem of blame in relation to ADHD diagnoses and Ritalin use from the perspective of mothers of boys with ADHD. Qualitative interviews with mothers suggest that medicalization of problematic behaviors in young boys includes an inherent narrative of blame transformation; this transformation can be expressed as a binarism: mother-blame–brain-blame. The first two sections of the paper document mothers’ experiences of blame for their sons’ symptomatic behaviors against the background of a cultural mothering ideology. The third section considers the promise of absolution from mother-blame inherent in the transformative binary structure. I argue that medicalization of boys’ problem behaviors supports and reconstitutes the potential for mother-blame and does little to pierce oppressive cultural mothering ideals.},

This chapter addresses this gap by developing an understanding of political information literacy and challenges the premise that information professionals and information organizations should remain neutral in the face of phenomena like censorship through noise and disinformation. In this endeavor, it reviews contemporary information environments vis-à-vis the growth of fake news and misinformation, and current information literacy approaches utilized by information organizations. Thereafter, it explores several cognitive barriers, such as the role of confirmation bias, information avoidance, information groupishness, and information overload, which affects people’s ability to process information. Finally, it encourages information professionals to hold regular information sessions on politically charged topics, tackle the cognitive factors increasing misinformation, and cultivate multidisciplinary approaches to confront fake news.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In clinical practice, discrepancies are observed between self and proxy reports of various aspects of Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aimed at  assessing self-awareness of memory function in PD both by comparing patients' and  caregivers' questionnaire ratings of the patients' memory and by correlating  subjective ratings with verbal learning results. METHOD: Forty-five patient-proxy  pairs participated in the study. Self-Rating Scale of Memory Functions was used as a  questionnaire subjective measure. Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) was applied  to assess verbal memory, Stroop test to assess cognitive control and Mini-Mental  State Examination (MMSE) for global cognitive assessment. RESULTS: Patient  self-reports did not diverge appreciably from proxy reports when global scores were  considered, but patient-proxy consistency was low for individual items with the  exception of those referring to verbal recall. Both patient and proxy ratings were  moderately correlated with the objective measures. Patient-proxy discrepancies were  associated with lower verbal learning, poor cognitive control and more severe PD  symptomatology. Moreover, depression was associated with patients' overestimation of  symptoms. CONCLUSION: Self-awareness of memory function is relatively well preserved  in PD, but is negatively affected by depressive symptoms. Patient-proxy  discrepancies increase also with disease severity, degree of memory problems and  cognitive control deficits. Caregivers seem to be unaware of the specificity of  memory problems in PD and report only some of them, mainly those related to verbal  recall.},

This study aimed to unravel the modulating role of depression in response  execution and inhibition in FM using an emotional go/no-go task. MATERIALS AND  METHODS: In total, 17 FM patients with low depression, 18 FM patients with high  depression, and 18 pain-free controls were included. Pain, happy, and neutral faces  were pseudorandomly presented, and participants were asked to respond to male faces  (go trials) by pressing a button, and to inhibit their responses if female faces  were presented (no-go trials). RESULTS: FM patients with high depression showed  lower positive affect scores, higher negative affect and pain vigilance scores, and  slower reaction times, than FM patients with low depression and pain-free controls.  Both subgroups of FM patients also rated pain faces as more arousing than pain-free  controls. The lack of group differences in our electrophysiological data, neither in  N200 nor in P300 amplitudes, seems to indicate that there was no significant  impairment in response execution in response inhibition due to pain. DISCUSSION:  Taken together, these results add evidence to the notion that depression is  associated with higher affective dysregulation and deficit of information-processing  speed in FM. Furthermore, our data suggest that pain induces a bias to pain-related  information, but the absence of significant group differences in event-related  potential amplitudes, calculated with analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) (with pain  intensity), seem to show that pain intensity is not a predictor for cognitive  dysfunctions.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The occurrence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has significantly increased in the last few years. One of the common problems in this group are eating disorders and ailments from the gastrointestinal systems. According to some studies, these problems have a significant impact on the occurrence and severity of symptoms in the neurological system, so it is crucial to increase the attention paid on the role of diet in the treatment of this disease. One of the theories connects ASD with disorders of the digestive system and the intestinal bacterial flora. This theory is based on the gut-brain axis, which means the interaction between the gastrointestinal and nervous systems. Objectives: To demonstrate the differences in behavior habits, interest in nutrition, and frequency of consumption of food products between children suffering from ASD and healthy children. Materials and methods: The study was conducted among 44 children suffering from ASD and 33 healthy children as a control group. Data were collected using a questionnaire that was specially designed for this study. The questionnaire contained questions about eating habits and the frequency of consumption of selected food products. Results: Parents of healthy children showed more interest in their children's way of feeding and nutritional recommendations compared to parents of children with ASD (4\% and 11.3\%, respectively). In addition, 24.3\% more children with ASD consulted with a nutritionist compared to the control group. Complaints of the digestive system were 21.1\% more likely by children with ASD. Children suffering from ASD were characterized by a higher intake of red meat and giblets and less frequent consumption of milk and milk products compared to the control group. There were no statistically significant differences between the study group and the control group in terms of frequency of consumption of products, which are the source of gluten, artificial food additives-preservatives, and artificial colors. Conclusions: There are differences in the habits and eating behaviors and the frequency of consumption of selected food products between a group of children with ASD and a group of healthy children.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Several immunological biomarkers are altered in late-life major depressive disorder (LLD). Immunological alterations could contribute to LLD's  consequences, but little is known about the relations between specific immunological  biomarkers and brain health in LLD. We performed an exploratory pilot study to  identify, from several candidates, the specific immunological biomarkers related to  important aspects of brain health that are altered in LLD (brain structure and  executive function). METHODS: Adults (n\,=\,31) were at least 60\,years old and had  major depressive disorder. A multiplex immunoassay assessed 13 immunological  biomarkers, and we examined their associations with structural MRI (grey matter  volume and white matter hyperintensity volume (WMH)) and executive function  (Color-Word Interference and Trail-Making tests) measures. RESULTS: Vascular  endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the chemokine eotaxin had significant negative  associations with grey matter volume (VEGF: n\,=\,31, r\,=\,-0.65; eotaxin: n\,=\,29,  r\,=\,-0.44). Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) had a significant positive  relationship with WMHs (n\,=\,30, r\,=\,0.52); interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and macrophage  inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α) were also significantly associated with WMHs  (IFN-γ: n\,=\,31, r\,=\,0.48; MIP-1α: n\,=\,29, r\,=\,0.45). Only eotaxin was associated  with executive function (set-shifting performance as measured with the Trail-making  test: n\,=\,33, r\,=\,-0.43). CONCLUSIONS: Immunological markers are associated with  brain structure in LLD. We found the immunological correlates of grey and white  matter differ. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate whether these  immunological correlates of brain health increase the risk of LLD's consequences.  Eotaxin, which correlated with both grey matter volume and set-shifting performance,  may be particularly relevant to neurodegeneration and cognition in LLD.

DESIGN: This is an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING:  Outpatient psychiatry. PARTICIPANTS: Unipolar depressed patients aged 75 years and  older. INTERVENTION: Citalopram (20-40 mg/day) or placebo pill. MEASUREMENTS:  Baseline Stroop Color-Word Test and weekly 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for  Depression assessments. RESULTS: Citalopram-treated patients with DRI did  significantly worse than placebo-treated patients with DRI. Conversely,  citalopram-treated patients without DRI did significantly better than  placebo-treated patients without DRI. CONCLUSION: Patients with late-life depression  and DRI respond worse to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) than placebo.  These findings suggest that there may be a deleterious interaction between DRI and  antidepressant medication in late-life depression and that the mechanism of SSRI and  placebo response is different.},

We verified whether this syndrome also occurs in nonelderly  stroke patients by investigating the association between domains of depressive  symptoms with executive functions in 87 first-ever ischemic stroke patients. The  retardation domain of the 31-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression was  associated with decreased performance on verbal fluency (assessed with FAS). The  association was maintained for younger patients (aged {$<$}60 years) after adjusting for  confounders. This result supports the clinical presentation of depression-executive  dysfunction syndrome in younger stroke patients. Confirmation of this finding, its  neural correlates, and clinical implication deserve further investigation.},

The authors undertook meta-analyses of the efficacy of dietary (restricted elimination diets, artificial food color exclusions, and free fatty acid supplementation) and psychological (cognitive training, neurofeedback, and behavioral interventions) ADHD treatments. METHOD: Using a common systematic search and a rigorous coding and data extraction strategy across domains, the authors searched electronic databases to identify published randomized controlled trials that involved individuals who were diagnosed with ADHD (or who met a validated cutoff on a recognized rating scale) and that included an ADHD outcome. RESULTS: Fifty-four of the 2,904 nonduplicate screened records were included in the analyses. Two different analyses were performed. When the outcome measure was based on ADHD assessments by raters closest to the therapeutic setting, all dietary (standardized mean differences=0.21-0.48) and psychological (standardized mean differences=0.40-0.64) treatments produced statistically significant effects. However, when the best probably blinded assessment was employed, effects remained significant for free fatty acid supplementation (standardized mean difference=0.16) and artificial food color exclusion (standardized mean difference=0.42) but were substantially attenuated to nonsignificant levels for other treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Free fatty acid supplementation produced small but significant reductions in ADHD symptoms even with probably blinded assessments, although the clinical significance of these effects remains to be determined. Artificial food color exclusion produced larger effects but often in individuals selected for food sensitivities. Better evidence for efficacy from blinded assessments is required for behavioral interventions, neurofeedback, cognitive training, and restricted elimination diets before they can be supported as treatments for core ADHD symptoms.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many older adults with depressive disorder manifest anxious distress. This longitudinal study examines the predictive value of worry as a maladaptive  cognitive emotion regulation strategy, and resources necessary for successful  emotion regulation (i.e., cognitive control and resting heart rate variability  [HRV]) for the course of anxiety symptoms in depressed older adults. Moreover, it  examines whether these emotion regulation variables moderate the impact of negative  life events on severity of anxiety symptoms. METHODS: Data of 378 depressed older  adults (CIDI) between 60 and 93 years (of whom 144 [41\%] had a comorbid anxiety  disorder) from the Netherlands Study of Depression in Older Adults (NESDO) were  used. Latent Growth Mixture Modeling was used to identify different course  trajectories of six-months BAI scores. Univariable and multivariable longitudinal  associations of worry, cognitive control and HRV with symptom course trajectories  were assessed. RESULTS: We identified a course trajectory with low and improving  symptoms (57.9\%), a course trajectory with moderate and persistent symptoms (33.5\%),  and a course trajectory with severe and persistent anxiety symptoms (8.6\%). Higher  levels of worry and lower levels of cognitive control predicted persistent and  severe levels of anxiety symptoms independent of presence of anxiety disorder.  However, worry, cognitive control and HRV did not moderate the impact of negative  life events on anxiety severity. CONCLUSIONS: Worry may be an important and  malleable risk factor for persistence of anxiety symptoms in depressed older adults.  Given the high prevalence of anxious depression in older adults, modifying worry may  constitute a viable venue for alleviating anxiety levels.},

Dans "Saison brune", Philippe Squarzoni tisse un récit inédit, qui entremêle analyses scientifiques et interviews de spécialistes, considérations personnelles et hommages au cinéma, enquête politique et essai engagé. Le livre est découpé en six chapitres. Les deux premiers chapitres sont consacrés aux aspects scientifiques du réchauffement : le fonctionnement du climat, la description de l'effet de serre, l'augmentation des gaz à effet de serre dans l'atmosphère durant l'époque moderne. Mais aussi l'expertise menée par le GIEC, l'attribution du réchauffement aux activités humaines, les différents scénarios d'augmentation des températures à venir, les risques d'effets de seuil, les risques de rétroactions positives. Dans les deux chapitres suivants, Philippe Squarzoni alterne entre l'examen des conséquences à venir du réchauffement climatique (fonte des glaciers, montée des eaux, multiplication des tempêtes, risques de sécheresse dans certaines régions...) et les questionnements du narrateur et de sa compagne face à cette situation inédite.Dans les deux derniers chapitres, Squarzoni élargit son questionnement et examine les possibilités de réduction des émissions et les différents scénarios énergétiques qui s'offrent à nos sociétés (énergies renouvelables, nucléaire, progrès technologiques, maîtrise de l'énergie...). Entre les insuffisances des unes, et les faux espoirs des autres, il décrit une alternative possible qui permettrait d'éviter les conséquences les plus graves du réchauffement climatique. Et les choix politiques, les modèles de société, que ces scénarios impliquent.},

  abstract = {Few studies have examined functional connectivity (FC) patterns using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to predict outcomes in late-life depression. We  hypothesized that FC within and between frontal and limbic regions would be  associated with 12-week depression outcome in older depressed adults. Seventy-one  subjects with major depression were enrolled in the study. A study geriatric  psychiatrist performed a clinical interview and completed a Montgomery-Åsberg  Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). All study participants were free of medication at  baseline and had a brain fMRI scan. Using a regions of interest (ROI) atlas  (including 164 ROIs), we conducted ROI-to-ROI resting-state FC analyses for each  participant. In terms of treatment participants were offered sertraline initially,  although in this naturalistic study, other medications were also prescribed.  Subjects were evaluated every 2 weeks up to 12 weeks by the study psychiatrist, who  followed a flexible, clinically based medication dosing schedule. Multivariate  regression analysis was used to examine correlation between change of MADRS score  over 12 weeks and baseline FC between brain regions, controlling for age, gender,  mean head motion, and baseline MADRS. We found greater FC between the left inferior  frontal gyrus pars triangularis and the left frontal eye field and FC of these two  regions with a number of brain regions related to reward, salience, and  sensorimortor function were correlated with change in MADRS score over 12 weeks. Our  results highlight the important role of between inner speech-reward,  attention-salience, and attention-sensorimotor network synchronization in predicting  acute treatment response in late-life depression.},

In the past 38 years, there have been studies of adverse behavioral reactions such as hyperactivity in children to double-blind challenges with AFCs. Studies that used 50 mg or more of AFCs as the challenge showed a greater negative effect on more children than those which used less. The study reported here is the first to quantify the amounts of AFCs in foods (specifically in beverages) commonly consumed by children in the United States. Consumption data for all foods would be helpful in the design of more challenge studies. The data summarized here should help clinicians advise parents about AFCs and beverage consumption.},

Of children with suspected sensitivities, 65\% to 89\% reacted when challenged with at least 100 mg of AFC. Oligoantigenic diet studies suggested that some children in addition to being sensitive to AFCs are also sensitive to common nonsalicylate foods (milk, chocolate, soy, eggs, wheat, corn, legumes) as well as salicylate-containing grapes, tomatoes, and orange. Some studies found "cosensitivity" to be more the rule than the exception. Recently, 2 large studies demonstrated behavioral sensitivity to AFCs and benzoate in children both with and without ADHD. A trial elimination diet is appropriate for children who have not responded satisfactorily to conventional treatment or whose parents wish to pursue a dietary investigation.},

  abstract = {This review examines the research on mechanisms by which artificial food colors (AFCs) and common foods may cause behavioral changes in children with and without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Children with ADHD show excess inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Studies have shown that a subgroup of children (with or without ADHD) react adversely to challenges with AFCs. Many early studies found few children who reacted to challenges with 20-40\,mg of AFCs. However, studies using at least 50\,mg of AFCs showed a greater percentage of children who reacted to the challenge. Three types of potential mechanisms are explored: toxicological, antinutritional, and hypersensitivity. Suggestions for future studies in animals and/or children include dose studies as well as studies to determine the effects of AFCs on the immune system, the intestinal mucosa, and nutrient absorption. Given the potential negative behavioral effects of AFCs, it is important to determine why some children may be more sensitive to AFCs than others and to identify the tolerable upper limits of exposure for children in general and for children at high risk.},

Exactly how they might leverage that trust remains unclear and untested. Building on recent work in correcting health misperceptions on social media, this study tests whether libraries can leverage trust to combat misinformation online. Using a misperception about the influenza vaccine as a test case, an experiment (n\,=\,625) was conducted in fall 2018 using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Results suggest that the misperception can be reduced, but not by library institutions. An unsuccessful follow-up (n\,=\,600) suggests that the effectiveness of the correction is season dependent and opens the possibility that libraries may yet play a role, but not necessarily because they are trusted. Future library proposals for combating misinformation need to be developed and tested within a broader contemporary misinformation research program.},

The response from the profession has been to reaffirm the core values of librarianship and to hold up traditional services as a means for combating misinformation. The problem is that these solutions are offered in the absence of a full understanding of the real danger of misinformation, which is “not just [that] misinformation is ‘out there,’” but “what misinformation does to our mind” (Ecker, 2015: 22). Misinformation research in other fields directly challenges the solutions proposed by library professionals and casts doubts on their underlying assumptions. This article provides an overview of the library and information science approach to misinformation in the United States, discusses the shortcomings of that approach, and points to possible next steps for remedying the problem.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), treatment outcomes with currently available strategies are often disappointing. Therefore, it is sensible to develop  new strategies to increase remission rates in acutely depressed patients. Many  studies reported that true drug response can be observed within 14 days (early  improvement) of antidepressant treatment. The identical time course of symptom  amelioration after early improvement in patients treated with antidepressants of all  classes or with placebo strongly suggests a common biological mechanism, which is  not specific for a particular antidepressant medication. However, the biology  underlying early improvement and final treatment response is not understood and  there is no established biological marker as yet, which can predict treatment  response for the individual patient before initiation or during the course of  antidepressant treatment. Peripheral blood markers and executive functions are  particularly promising candidates as markers for the onset of action and thus the  prediction of final treatment outcome in MDD. METHODS/DESIGN: The present paper  presents the rationales, objectives and methods of a multi-centre study applying  close-meshed repetitive measurements of peripheral blood and neuropsychological  parameters in patients with MDD and healthy controls during a study period of eight  weeks for the identification of biomarkers for the onset of antidepressants' action  in patients with MDD. Peripheral blood parameters and depression severity are  assessed in weekly intervals from baseline to week 8, executive performance in  bi-weekly intervals. Patients are participating in a randomized controlled  multi-level clinical trial, healthy controls are matched according to mean age, sex  and general intelligence. DISCUSSION: This investigation will help to identify a  biomarker or a set of biomarkers with decision-making quality in the treatment of  MDD in order to increase the currently disappointing remission rates of  antidepressant treatment.},

  abstract = {Jeffrey Beall, a US librarian, coined the term “predatory publishing” specifically to describe a movement or phenomenon of open access (OA) journals and publishers that he and others believed displayed exploitative and unscholarly principles. Using a blog to transmit those ideas, and profiling specific cases using blacklists, one of the most polemic aspects of Beall's blog was its tendency to attract and incite academic radicalism. Beall targeted both publishers and standalone journals, but how he precisely determined that an OA journal or a publisher was predatory was in many cases an ambiguity. Beall's deficient and highly subjective criteria, as well as those blacklists' incapacity to clearly distinguish low quality OA publishers from predatory ones, may have negatively impacted the operations of several Beall-blacklisted OA journals and publishers. Freedom of speech that embraces prejudice, via Beall's blog, and the establishment of “predatory” blacklists, are enhanced discriminatory ideologies that continue to be carried downstream from Beall to and by other like-minded individuals and groups who proliferate academic divisiveness and may also be formalizing and institutionalizing a culture of discriminative philosophies by cloning Beall's blacklists and encouraging their continued use.},

Quelques mois plus tard, l'épidémie de Covid-19 offrait, à l'échelle mondiale, un cas d'usage frappant des dispositifs que je m'étais efforcé de décrire.On a vu des officines de toutes tailles, hier positionnées sur le juteux secteur de la sécurité, pivoter vers un nouvel impératif, celui de la traque des corps malades – un levier encore plus puissant que la lutte contre le terrorisme. Des applications de traçage, de "suivi des contacts', ont été développées un peu partout, misant sur le numérique pour endiguer la course du virus. Dans le ciel, des drones sortis d'un futur proche ont fait respecter le confinement. On a confié à des caméras le soin de s'assurer du port du masque et du respect de la distanciation sociale.La crise sanitaire a mis au jour la présence de ces dispositifs de surveillance toujours plus nombreux, dont elle a dans le même temps assis la légitimité et accéléré la banalisation. On me demande souvent s'il faut craindre la généralisation d'une surveillance dite de masse ; et s'il s'agissait plutôt d'une massification de la surveillance ? "Olivier Tesquet},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To test our hypothesis that pre-treatment executive function and brain regional activation during executive function would discriminate between responders  and non-responders to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in elderly depressed  outpatients. DESIGN: Clinical cohort study. SETTING: University-affiliated hospital.  PARTICIPANTS: Sixty outpatients (age 59 years and older) completed 12 weeks of CBT  between July 2010 and December 2011. Forty-four completed fMRI procedures.  MEASUREMENTS: The main outcome consisted of a conversion from a clinical diagnosis  (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview) of depression to no clinical  diagnosis of depression or a significant improvement in diagnostic criteria. Brain  activation measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging during the Wisconsin  Card Sorting task (WCST) was the primary predictor variable. RESULTS: 67\% of  patients had a positive response to CBT. Decreased activation in the left inferior  frontal triangle and right superior frontal gyrus as well as increased activity in  the right middle frontal gyrus and left superior frontal gyrus predicted a positive  response to CBT. Demographic and neurocognitive measures of WCST performance were  not significant predictors of a positive CBT outcome, whereas the measure of  WCST-induced activity in the prefrontal cortex was a significant predictor.  CONCLUSIONS: These data are among the first to suggest that measures of prefrontal  brain activation during executive functioning predict response to CBT in older  adults. Further exploration of the specific underlying processes that these  prefrontal cortical regions are engaging that contributes to better CBT outcomes is  warranted in larger, randomized studies.},

The aim of this article is to present some of the digital tools that increase the efficiency of scientific research and facilitate conceptual work, information retrieval, note-taking and writing up of research.  Approach/Methods: The research process comprised several stages, each of which focused on a specific tool that directly increases work efficiency and performs functions beyond human capabilities.  Results and conclusions: The latest digital tools are equipped with features that increase efficiency at all stages of the research process. They speed up the completion of a task (e.g. searching for information) and illuminate the relationships between documents or individual concepts that researchers themselves would not register (e.g. through the visualization of data and information).  Originality/Value: The skillful use of modern digital tools is a fundamental element of digital wisdom as computer programs and Web applications significantly broaden human perception and cognitive capabilities.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a robust empirical evidence base supporting the acute efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for severe and treatment resistant depression.  However, a major limitation, probably contributing to its declining use, is that ECT  is associated with impairment in cognition, notably in anterograde and retrograde  memory and executive function. Preclinical and preliminary human data suggests that  ketamine, used either as the sole anaesthetic agent or in addition to other  anaesthetics, may reduce or prevent cognitive impairment following ECT. A putative  hypothesis is that ketamine, through antagonising glutamate receptors, protects from  excess excitatory neurotransmitter stimulation during ECT. The primary aim of the  ketamine-ECT study is to investigate whether adjunctive ketamine can attenuate the  cognitive impairment caused by ECT. Its secondary aim is to examine if ketamine  increases the speed of clinical improvement with ECT. METHODS/DESIGN: The ketamine  ECT study is a multi-site randomised, placebo-controlled, double blind trial. It was  originally planned to recruit 160 moderately to severely depressed patients who had  been clinically prescribed ECT. This recruitment target was subsequently revised to  100 patients due to recruitment difficulties. Patients will be randomly allocated on  a 1:1 basis to receive either adjunctive ketamine or saline in addition to standard  anaesthesia for ECT. The primary neuropsychological outcome measure is anterograde  verbal memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised delayed recall task) after 4 ECT  treatments. Secondary cognitive outcomes include verbal fluency, autobiographical  memory, visuospatial memory and digit span. Efficacy is assessed using observer and  self-report efficacy measures of depressive symptomatology. The effects of ECT and  ketamine on cortical activity during cognitive tasks will be studied in a sub-sample  using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). DISCUSSION: The ketamine-ECT  study aims to establish whether or not adjunctive ketamine used together with  standard anaesthesia for ECT will significantly reduce the adverse cognitive effects  observed after ECT. Potential efficacy benefits of increased speed of symptom  improvement and a reduction in the number of ECT treatments required will also be  assessed, as will safety and tolerability of adjunctive ketamine. This study will  provide important evidence as to whether adjunctive ketamine is routinely indicated  for ECT given for depression in routine NHS clinical practice.

Less is known whether this applies to samples derived from  the general population. We aimed to study cognitive functioning in a  population-based sample comprising individuals with schizophrenia, other  non-affective psychoses, bipolar disorders, major depressive disorder, and controls  derived from the same population. The current analysis was based on 148 persons with  severe mental disorders and 66 control subjects, derived from the Psychoses in  Finland study. All subjects were interviewed with SCID, and a neuropsychological  test battery was administered. Subjects with schizophrenia had a generalized  cognitive impairment (d = 0.43-1.07), while those with other non-affective psychoses  were impaired in verbal memory and processing speed (d = 0.43-0.59). Subjects with  bipolar disorders were not impaired. Unipolar major depressive disorder associated  with slowed processing speed (d = 0.64). Our findings on cognitive impairments in  subjects with schizophrenia and other non-affective psychoses derived from the  general population support previous findings of a generalized cognitive dysfunction  in these subjects. However, our results suggest that subjects with bipolar disorders  from non-clinical populations may not have significant cognitive impairments. Our  results emphasize the importance of using control samples derived from the same  population and studied similarly as those with disorders in evaluating cognitive  functioning of subjects with severe mental disorders.},

  abstract = {Objective Attention Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Chronic Tic Disorder (CTD) are two common and frequently co-existing disorders, probably following an additive model. But this is not yet clear for the basic sensory function of colour processing sensitive to dopaminergic functioning in the retina and higher cognitive functions like attention and interference control. The latter two reflect important aspects for psychoeducation and behavioural treatment approaches. Methods Colour discrimination using the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue Test, sustained attention during the Frankfurt Attention Inventory (FAIR), and interference liability during Colour- and Counting-Stroop-Tests were assessed to further clarify the cognitive profile of the co-existence of ADHD and CTD. Altogether 69 children were classified into four groups: ADHD (N = 14), CTD (N = 20), ADHD+CTD (N = 20) and healthy Controls (N = 15) and compared in cognitive functioning in a 2x2-factorial statistical model. Results Difficulties with colour discrimination were associated with both ADHD and CTD factors following an additive model, but in ADHD these difficulties tended to be more pronounced on the blue-yellow axis. Attention problems were characteristic for ADHD but not CTD. Interference load was significant in both Colour-and Counting-Stroop-Tests and unrelated to colour discrimination. Compared to Controls, interference load in the Colour-Stroop was higher in pure ADHD and in pure CTD, but not in ADHD+CTD, following a sub-additive model. In contrast, interference load in the Counting-Stroop did not reveal ADHD or CTD effects. Conclusion The co-existence of ADHD and CTD is characterized by additive as well as sub-additive performance impairments, suggesting that their co-existence may show simple additive characteristics of both disorders or a more complex interaction, depending on demand. The equivocal findings on interference control may indicate limited validity of the Stroop-Paradigm for clinical assessments.},

The aim of this systematic review was therefore to investigate the current knowledge of diet interventions as a treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents Methods:A systematic literature search in PubMed was conducted, identifying randomized controlled trials investigating diet interventions to treat ADHD in children and adolescents. Results:The study populations were generally small and the studies varied in duration and nature of the exposure. Overall 10 out of 12 studies spoke in favour of an elimination diet, 2 out of 6 of eliminating artificial food colourings from the diet and none in favour of eliminating sucrose or aspartame from the diet to treat ADHD. Conclusion:The current evidence is not enough to recommend treating ADHD with diet interventions, but a subgroup of children and adolescents might warrant from elimination of certain food-items. Further investigations of the mechanism and effect of diet interventions to treat ADHD is needed.},

  abstract = {Rumination is a cognitive-affective thinking style that plays a key role in the onset and maintenance of depression. Recently, it was shown that clinically  depressed patients who received a neurocognitive training - involving two weeks of  repetitive cognitive control exercises that necessitate prefrontal engagement - are  more able to control over ruminative negative thoughts than patients who only  received treatment as usual. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a  biological technique that can directly modulate prefrontal excitability via the  manipulation of neural membrane potentials. In this randomized double-blind trial,  we investigated whether bifrontal tDCS (anode over the left/cathode over the right  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)) would enhance the influence of a  neurocognitive training on depressive brooding, the maladaptive form of rumination.  Major depressed patients were trained using a procedure based on the Paced Auditory  Serial Addition Task (PASAT), a task that relies heavily on working memory and is  found to engage the DLPFC. One group (n=19) completed the PASAT training together  with active tDCS and another group (n=14) completed the same training together with  sham (placebo) tDCS. In both groups, depressive brooding was reduced following the  PASAT training. Moreover, we observed that improvement in working memory over the  course of the training was associated with a greater reduction in depressive  brooding post- versus pre-intervention. However, tDCS did not moderate this  association between changes in working memory and changes in depressive brooding.  Possible explanations for this absent moderation of tDCS, as well as avenues for  future research to influence ruminative thinking in depression, are discussed.},

In cases of persistent non-response to  treatment, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a safe and effective treatment  strategy with high response rates. Unfortunately, longitudinal data show low  sustained response rates with 6-month relapse rates as high as 50\% using existing  relapse prevention strategies. Cognitive side effects of ECT, even though transient,  might trigger mechanisms that increase relapse in patients who initially responded  to ECT. Among these side effects, reduced cognitive control is an important  neurobiological driven vulnerability factor for depression. As such, cognitive  control training (CCT) holds promise as a non-pharmacological strategy to improve  long-term effects of ECT (i.e., increase remission, and reduce depression relapse).  METHOD/DESIGN: Eighty-eight patients aged between 18 and 70\,years with MDE who start  CCT will be included in this randomized controlled trial (RCT). Following (partial)  response to ECT treatment (at least a 25\% reduction of clinical symptoms), patients  will be randomly assigned to a computer based CCT or active placebo control. A first  aim of this RCT is to assess the effects of CCT compared to an active placebo  condition on depression symptomatology, cognitive complaints, and quality of life.  Secondly, we will monitor patients every 2~weeks for a period of 6~months following  CCT/active placebo, allowing the detection of potential relapse of depression.  Thirdly, we will assess patient evaluation of the addition of cognitive remediation  to ECT using qualitative interview methods (satisfaction, acceptability and  appropriateness). Finally, in order to further advance our understanding of the  mechanisms underlying effects of CCT, exploratory analyses will be conducted using  video footage collected during the CCT/active control phase of the study.  DISCUSSION: Cognitive remediation will be performed following response to ECT, and  an extensive follow-up period will be employed.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Rumination, cognitive control deficits, cognitive saturation, and loss of inhibition are the major hypotheses used to explain depressive disorders. A few  studies have nevertheless looked at the form of thought. In this study, we will test  a double measurement of the number of thoughts and a double measurement of the flow  of thought together with their correlation with well-being, mental pain, and  depression. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between May and September 2015, 68 subjects,  initially admitted as emergencies for acute anxiety depressive disorders and/or  suicide attempts and subsequently monitored as post-emergency outpatients in  medico-psychological consultations agreed to complete a set of Visual Analogue  Scales measuring their well-being, their mental pain, their estimated number of  thoughts and the how agitated these thoughts are estimated to be. A double  evaluation of the cognitive activity consisted of representation intrusive thoughts  by filling a drawing of an aquarium to reflect the number of thoughts (by drawing  fish) and cognitive turmoil (by drawing wavy lines). The depressive illness was  evaluated using the Beck depression inventory and by rater-administered assessments  using MADRS (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Scale). RESULTS: These measurements are of  good psychometric quality (sensitivity, accuracy, validity). The mental pain is  related to mental turmoil. These results reveal positive correlations between the  mental turmoil and the total score on the depression. The use of the aquarium makes  it possible to distinguish the feeling of having "a lot of thoughts" from the  feeling of having "agitated thoughts". So, the total score of wavy lines shows  positive correlation with the total score on the depression inventory (BDI) and the  total MADRS score. DISCUSSION: The results suggest that the phenomena of cognitive  saturation and the sensation of mental restlessness play a major role in the  etiopathogensis of depression. The analyses show that the cognitive dysregulation is  situated more precisely at the level of the flow of thought rather than the level of  the number of thoughts. A deterioration in the flow of thought increases the mental  pain and the depressive symptoms, and reduces well-being. The sample is nevertheless  small, and some bias appears in the filling of the aquarium boxes.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The risk of cognitive impairment is a concern for patients with major depressive disorder receiving electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Here, we evaluate the  acute, short-term and long-term effects of ECT on tests of processing speed,  executive function, memory, and attention. METHODS: Forty-four patients with major  depressive disorder receiving ECT (61\% right unilateral, 39\% mixed right  unilateral-bitemporal, left unilateral, and/or bitemporal lead placement) underwent  a cognitive battery prior to ECT (T1), after 2 sessions (T2), and at the end of the  index (T3). Thirty-two patients returned for a 6-month follow-up (T4). Thirty-three  control subjects were assessed at 2 times approximately 4 weeks apart (C1 and C2).  RESULTS: At baseline, patients showed deficits in processing speed, executive  function, and memory compared with control subjects. Including depression severity  and lead placement covariates, linear mixed-model analysis showed significant  improvement in only processing speed between T1 and T3 and between T1 and T4 in  patients. An acute decline in attention and verbal memory was observed at T2, but  performance returned to baseline levels at T3. Longitudinal cognitive outcomes did  not differ in patients defined as ECT responders/nonresponders. LIMITATIONS:  Episodic memory was not measured, and medications were not controlled between T3 and  T4. Control subjects also showed improvements in processing speed, suggesting  practice effects for some measures. CONCLUSIONS: In this naturalistic ECT treatment  study, results show that the initiation of ECT may transiently affect memory and  executive function, but cognition is largely unaffected during and after ECT.  Whereas some functions might improve, others will at least remain stable up to 6  months following the ECT index.},

  abstract = {Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) etiology is not completely understood, but common comorbid dysfunction of the gastrointestinal and immune system suggests that these systems may be affected by a common genetic background and molecular mechanisms. For example, increased levels of specific cytokines were observed in ADHD. Moreover, ADHD has a high comorbidity with both Th1- and Th2-mediated disorders like ear infections, eczema and asthma. A common pathophysiological mechanism was suggested to underlie both asthma and ADHD, while several genes that are linked to ADHD have immune functions. Furthermore, immunological recognition of food provoking ADHD-like behavior was suggested. An immune imbalance, probably requiring a predisposing genetic background, is therefore suggested to contribute to ADHD etiology, with immune dysregulation being more likely than a single subcellular defect. However, next to allergic mechanisms, also pharmacological mechanisms (especially in case of food additives) might be involved. In addition, though cellular (cytokine-related) rather than antibody-mediated immune mechanisms seem involved, specific immune-inflammatory markers other than antibodies have not been systematically studied in ADHD. Substantial alterations implicated in ADHD apparently occur in the immune system and epigenetic regulation of gene expression. As a result, chronic inflammation and oxidative stress could develop, which can lead to ADHD symptoms, for example by chronic T-cell-mediated neuroinflammation. If immune pathways contribute to ADHD, both its diagnosis and treatment should be reconsidered. Modulation of immune system activity might have potential in ADHD treatment, for example by nutritional approaches providing safe and low-cost ADHD therapy, but further research in these fields is implicated.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is generally assumed that the elderly patients are more vulnerable to cognitive side effects after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) than younger depressed  patients. The current study aims to evaluate the nature and extent of changes across  multiple domains of neurocognitive functioning in a group of elderly depressed  patients after ECT. METHODS: In this prospective naturalistic study, we included 42  depressed patients aged ≥55 years. Global cognitive function, memory, and executive  function were assessed before ECT treatment and within one week (short-term  post-ECT) and six months after ECT (long-term post-ECT). Associations between  cognitive functioning and electrode placement, total number of treatment sessions,  age, and the severity of depression at the time of cognitive measurement were  studied. RESULTS: Our data offered no evidence of decline for any of the  neurocognitive tests after ECT, given its power to detect the difference. Post-ECT  improvement of neurocognitive functioning was statistically significant for the  Mini-Mental State Examination, Visual Association Test, 10 Words Verbal Learning  Test, and Expanded Mental Control Test. Effect sizes were medium to large. After six  months, compared with post-ECT performance, statistically significant improvement  was found only for the Trail Making Test-A and the Letter Fluency Test with small to  medium effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS: In our severely depressed elderly patients,  neurocognitive performance improved or did not change after ECT. Patients with poor  cognitive function were not able to participate in neuropsychological assessment  before ECT started. Consequently these results may not apply to patients with more  severe cognitive impairment prior to the start of ECT.},

  abstract = {La maladie de Parkinson représente une atteinte particulière du système nerveux central, caractérisée par un dysfonctionnement chronique des noyaux gris centraux, dont le rôle est essentiel dans le contrôle de l'exécution des plans moteurs appris. Sa physiopathologie provoque une rigidité générale des muscles, des tremblements (surtout des membres) et une difficulté à démarrer les séquences motrices. Outre un ralentissement général des mouvements (bradykinésie) ses conséquences sur les muscles du conduit vocal et du larynx sont aggravées par un manque de sensations proprioceptives de la langue et de la mandibule provoqué par l'atteinte des ganglions de la base. Les troubles de la production de parole au cours de la maladie de Parkinson constituent un des marqueurs cliniques représentatifs de l'évolution du handicap moteur à l'instar d'autres activités motrices complexes comme les troubles de l'équilibre et de la marche. Les troubles de la parole pénalisent particulièrement l'autonomie des patients en détériorant leur capacité de communication au cours de l'évolution de la maladie La caractéristique principale des troubles de la production vocale observés au cours de la maladie de Parkinson est une dysarthrie qualifiée d'hypokinétique, ce terme faisant non seulement référence à la réduction des mouvements articulatoires mais aussi à la diminution de la modulation prosodique de la parole par ailleurs qualifiée de monotone.On constate au cours de la maladie une progression « caudo-rostrale » des troubles du conduit vocal, débutant au niveau laryngé pour atteindre ensuite la partie postérieure de la constriction linguo-palatine, puis sa partie antérieure et enfin la constriction bilabiale.La précession d'une dysphonie et de la dysprosodie est rapportée d'une manière générale chez les patients parkinsoniens avec handicap moteur faible et indépendants dans leur vie quotidienne. Les anomalies observées globalement sont une réduction d'intensité, une monotonie et un débit ralenti que l'on peut définir plus précisément par la diminution d'énergie du signal vocal, la réduction de variabilité de la hauteur (dynamique de la Fo) et l'augmentation du nombre de pauses « non remplies ». Comme elle apparaît dés les premières atteintes de la maladie, l'insuffisance prosodique constitue probablement la marque la plus spécifique des troubles de la parole dans la maladie de Parkinson.Apparaissent ensuite, des atteintes articulatoires qui dégradent progressivement l'intelligibilité.Outre l'imprécision des consonnes, déviance assez peu spécifique puisqu'elle est présente dans toutes les dysarthries, les anomalies articulatoires dans la maladie de Parkinson portent essentiellement sur les consonnes occlusives, lesquelles sont perçues comme des constrictives, témoignant d'une fermeture insuffisante du conduit vocal.Pour les voyelles, la tendance à la réduction de la surface du triangle vocalique rapportée chez les patients parkinsoniens peut rendre compte de la dédifférenciation des voyelles, ce qui contribue avec les phénomènes de spirantisation et de coarticulation à la réduction des contrastes acoustiques. L'image d'une trajectoire évolutive globale des troubles de la parole au cours de la maladie de Parkinson ne doit pas faire oublier la très grande variabilité interindividuelle du phénotype et de tenir compte de la problématique générale de reproductibilité des observations et des enregistrements chez un patient donné.},

  abstract = {AIMS: To estimate the mortality risk related to different mood disorders in a geriatric sample of subjects aged 70 years and over without dementia. METHOD: All  non-demented subjects at baseline who participate on a second phase of a  population-based cohort study were included. Adjusted Cox proportional hazards  models were used to determine the association between depression and 5-year survival  of 451 elderly people without dementia originally recruited for a representative  community dementia cohort study. Baseline evaluation included the Cambridge Mental  Disorders of the Elderly Examination Schedule. Depressive disorders (major and minor  episode) were assessed according DSM-IV criteria and classified according the age of  onset (late vs. early). The late-onset depression was classified according to the  presence or absence of depression-executive dysfunction syndrome (DEDS). RESULTS:  The initial cohort size was 451 subjects, among which 10.9\% (n = 49) suffered a  major depressive episode and 10.4\% (n = 47) a minor depressive disorder. Among the  total affective disorders, 77.9\% (n = 74) were late-onset depressions and 29.5\% (n =  28) had executive dysfunction. After 5 years, the vital status of 94\% (n = 424) of  the participants was known and the mortality was 18.9\% (n = 80). Late-onset major  depressive episode with executive dysfunction was related to mortality after  adjustment by age, gender, marital status, level of education, comorbidity (or  health global status) and cognitive impairment (HR = 3.70; 95\% CI = 1.55-8.83). The  executive dysfunction was found to be an independent mortality risk factor (HR =  2.05; 95\% CI = 1.15-3.64). CONCLUSIONS: There is a statistically significant  association between mortality and late-onset major depression with executive  dysfunction.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Greater psychological resilience may protect against developing depression in a growing geriatric population. Identifying the neural correlates of  resilience in geriatric depression could provide neurobiologic targets to inform  clinical interventions. However, most prior neuroimaging studies have only  considered the presence or absence of resilience and have not addressed the  multifactorial nature of resilience. The current study aimed to establish the neural  correlates of four factors of resilience in the depressed elderly. METHODS: White  matter integrity was assessed using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging  data collected from 70 older adults with major depressive disorder. We used four  resilience factors previously derived in an exploratory factor analysis of the  Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale in a large sample of depressed older adults: 1,  grit; 2, active coping self-efficacy; 3, accommodative coping self-efficacy; and 4,  spirituality. RESULTS: The resilience factor "grit" was positively associated with  fractional anisotropy in the callosal region connecting prefrontal cortex and  fractional anisotropy in cingulum fibers; however, the latter did not survive  correction for multiple comparisons. CONCLUSION: Structural integrity of major white  matter pathways implicated in cognitive control and emotion regulation (i.e.,  connecting prefrontal cortex) was positively associated with the resilience factor  "grit" in our sample of older adults with depression. Prospective studies are needed  to determine the utility of the structural integrity of these pathways as a  biomarker in predicting risk for depression and treatment response.},

  abstract = {Artificial food dyes are made from petroleum and have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the enhancement of the color of processed foods. They are widely used in the food and pharmaceutical industries to increase the appeal and acceptability of their products. Synthetic food colorants can achieve hues not possible for natural colorants and are cheaper, more easily available, and last longer. However, since the use of artificial food coloring has become widespread, many allergic and other immune reactive disorders have increasingly been reported. During the past 50 y, the amount of synthetic dye used in foods has increased by 500\%. Simultaneously, an alarming rise has occurred in behavioral problems in children, such as aggression, attention deficit disorder (ADD), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The ingestion of food delivers the greatest foreign antigenic load that challenges the immune system. Artificial colors can also be absorbed via the skin through cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. The molecules of synthetic colorants are small, and the immune system finds it difficult to defend the body against them. They can also bond to food or body proteins and, thus, are able to act in stealth mode to circumvent and disrupt the immune system. The consumption of synthetic food colors, and their ability to bind with body proteins, can have significant immunological consequences. This consumption can activate the inflammatory cascade, can result in the induction of intestinal permeability to large antigenic molecules, and could lead to cross-reactivities, autoimmunities, and even neurobehavioral disorders. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recently found a 41\% increase in diagnoses of ADHD in boys of high-school age during the past decade. More shocking is the legal amount of artificial colorants allowed by the FDA in the foods, drugs, and cosmetics that we consume and use every day. The consuming public is largely unaware of the perilous truth behind the deceptive allure of artificial color.},

To investigate the time course of executive  functions during antidepressant treatment, repeated measures of executive functions  are necessary. In order to avoid practice effects, the assessment of alternate forms  is suggested. The aim of this study was to compare the processing times of four  alternate versions of the Trail Making Test (TMT) A and B in patients with MDD.  Fifty-five subjects with DSM-IV MDD were included in the study. We analyzed mean  processing times and retest reliability of the four versions of TMT A and B. Mean  processing times did not differ between the four tested versions of TMT A and B.  Retest reliability of TMT A and B was between 0.76 and 0.89 and between 0.86 and  0.94, respectively. Because of their identical difficulty and high reliability, the  herein described versions of the TMT A and B are suitable for sequential testing of  executive functioning.},

Neuropsychological function was  assessed before and immediately after TMS treatment with a battery of 8 tests.

  abstract = {This study investigated for the first time the broad autism phenotype (BAP) in the context of older adulthood and its associations with real-world executive function,  social support, and both depression and anxiety symptomatology. Based on  self-ratings of autistic traits, 66 older adults (60+ years old, range\,=\,61-88) were  split into BAP (n\,=\,20) and control (n\,=\,46) groups. Individuals in the BAP group,  even after controlling for age, education level, sex, and health problems, exhibited  more real-world executive function problems in multiple domains, reported lower  levels of social support, and self-rated increased depression and anxiety  symptomatology compared to the control group. Regression analysis revealed that  level of social support was the strongest predictor of BAP traits across both  groups, although real-world executive function problems and depression  symptomatology were also significant predictors. Moreover, when predicting anxiety  and depression symptomatology, BAP traits were the strongest predictors above and  beyond the effects of demographic factors, real-world executive function problems,  and social support levels. These findings suggest that the BAP in older adulthood  imparts additional risks to areas of functioning that are known to be crucial to  aging-related outcomes in the context of typical development. These results might in  turn inform aging in autism spectrum disorder, which has been largely unexplored to  date.

However, our ability to measure the social makeup of online communities and in turn, to understand the social organization of online platforms, is limited by the pseudonymous, unstructured and large-scale nature of digital discussion. Here we develop a neural-embedding methodology to quantify the positioning of online communities along social dimensions by leveraging large-scale patterns of aggregate behaviour. Applying our methodology to 5.1 billion comments made in 10,000 communities over 14 years on Reddit, we measure how the macroscale community structure is organized with respect to age, gender and US~political partisanship. Examining political content, we find that Reddit underwent a significant polarization event around the 2016 US~presidential election. Contrary to conventional wisdom, however, individual-level polarization is rare; the system-level shift in 2016 was disproportionately driven by the arrival of new users. Political polarization on Reddit is unrelated to previous activity on the platform and is instead temporally aligned with external events. We also observe a stark ideological asymmetry, with the sharp increase in polarization in 2016 being entirely attributable to changes in right-wing activity. This methodology is broadly applicable to the study of online interaction, and our findings have implications for the design of online platforms, understanding the social contexts of online behaviour, and quantifying the dynamics and mechanisms of online polarization.},

These findings  are not universally observed, and the mechanism by which this variation results in  increased risk for mood disorders is unclear. One possible explanation is an  epistatic relationship with other neurotransmitter genes associated with depression  risk, such as the serotonin-transporter-linked promotor region (5-HTTLPR). Further,  it is unclear how the coexistence of the BDNF Met and 5-HTTLPR S variants affects  the function of the affective and cognitive control systems. To address this  question, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in 38  older adults (20 healthy and 18 remitted from major depressive disorder). Subjects  performed an emotional oddball task during the fMRI scan and provided blood samples  for genotyping. Our analyses examined the relationship between genotypes and brain  activation to sad distractors and attentional targets. We found that 5-HTTLPR S  allele carriers exhibited stronger activation in the amygdala in response to sad  distractors, whereas BDNF Met carriers exhibited increased activation to sad stimuli  but decreased activation to attentional targets in the dorsolateral prefrontal and  dorsomedial prefrontal cortices. In addition, subjects with both the S allele and  Met allele genes exhibited increased activation to sad stimuli in the subgenual  cingulate and posterior cingulate. Our results indicate that the Met allele alone or  in combination with 5-HTTLPR S allele may increase reactivity to sad stimuli, which  might represent a neural mechanism underlying increased depression vulnerability.},

  abstract = {Major depressive disorder (MDD) is clinically, and likely pathophysiologically, heterogeneous. A potentially fruitful approach to parsing this heterogeneity is to  focus on promising endophenotypes. Guided by the NIMH Research Domain Criteria  initiative, we used source localization of scalp-recorded EEG resting data to  examine the neural correlates of three emerging endophenotypes of depression:  neuroticism, blunted reward learning, and cognitive control deficits. Data were  drawn from the ongoing multi-site EMBARC study. We estimated intracranial current  density for standard EEG frequency bands in 82 unmedicated adults with MDD, using  Low-Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography. Region-of-interest and whole-brain  analyses tested associations between resting state EEG current density and  endophenotypes of interest. Neuroticism was associated with increased resting gamma  (36.5-44 Hz) current density in the ventral (subgenual) anterior cingulate cortex  (ACC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). In contrast, reduced cognitive control  correlated with decreased gamma activity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  (dlPFC), decreased theta (6.5-8 Hz) and alpha2 (10.5-12 Hz) activity in the dorsal  ACC, and increased alpha2 activity in the right dlPFC. Finally, blunted reward  learning correlated with lower OFC and left dlPFC gamma activity. Computational  modeling of trial-by-trial reinforcement learning further indicated that lower OFC  gamma activity was linked to reduced reward sensitivity. Three putative  endophenotypes of depression were found to have partially dissociable resting  intracranial EEG correlates, reflecting different underlying neural dysfunctions.  Overall, these findings highlight the need to parse the heterogeneity of MDD by  focusing on promising endophenotypes linked to specific pathophysiological  abnormalities.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly heterogeneous condition in terms of symptom presentation and, likely, underlying pathophysiology. Accordingly,  it is possible that only certain individuals with MDD are well-suited to  antidepressants. A potentially fruitful approach to parsing this heterogeneity is to  focus on promising endophenotypes of depression, such as neuroticism, anhedonia, and  cognitive control deficits. METHODS: Within an 8-week multisite trial of sertraline  v. placebo for depressed adults (n = 216), we examined whether the combination of  machine learning with a Personalized Advantage Index (PAI) can generate  individualized treatment recommendations on the basis of endophenotype profiles  coupled with clinical and demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Five pre-treatment  variables moderated treatment response. Higher depression severity and neuroticism,  older age, less impairment in cognitive control, and being employed were each  associated with better outcomes to sertraline than placebo. Across 1000 iterations  of a 10-fold cross-validation, the PAI model predicted that 31\% of the sample would  exhibit a clinically meaningful advantage [post-treatment Hamilton Rating Scale for  Depression (HRSD) difference ⩾3] with sertraline relative to placebo. Although there  were no overall outcome differences between treatment groups (d = 0.15), those  identified as optimally suited to sertraline at pre-treatment had better week 8 HRSD  scores if randomized to sertraline (10.7) than placebo (14.7) (d = 0.58).  CONCLUSIONS: A subset of MDD patients optimally suited to sertraline can be  identified on the basis of pre-treatment characteristics. This model must be tested  prospectively before it can be used to inform treatment selection. However, findings  demonstrate the potential to improve individual outcomes through algorithm-guided  treatment recommendations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many patients have serious depression that is nonresponsive to medications, but refuse electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Early research suggested  that isoflurane anesthesia may be an effective alternative to ECT. Subsequent  studies altered drug, dose or number of treatments, and failed to replicate this  success, halting research on isoflurane's antidepressant effects for a decade. Our  aim was to re-examine whether isoflurane has antidepressant effects comparable to  ECT, with less adverse effects on cognition. METHOD: Patients with  medication-refractory depression received an average of 10 treatments of bifrontal  ECT (n = 20) or isoflurane (n = 8) over 3 weeks. Depression severity (Hamilton  Rating Scale for Depression-24) and neurocognitive responses (anterograde and  retrograde memory, processing speed and verbal fluency) were assessed at  Pretreatment, Post all treatments and 4-week Follow-up. RESULTS: Both treatments  produced significant reductions in depression scores at Post-treatment and 4-week  Follow-up; however, ECT had modestly better antidepressant effect at follow-up in  severity-matched patients. Immediately Post-treatment, ECT (but not isoflurane)  patients showed declines in memory, fluency, and processing speed. At Follow-up,  only autobiographical memory remained below Pretreatment level for ECT patients, but  isoflurane patients had greater test-retest neurocognitive score improvement.  CONCLUSIONS: Our data reconfirm that isoflurane has an antidepressant effect  approaching ECT with less adverse neurocognitive effects, and reinforce the need for  a larger clinical trial.},

The purpose of this study is to examine aberrations to cerebral  networks implicated in encoding novel verbal semantic material among older adults  with LLD. METHODS: Twenty-four older adults with early-onset LLD and 23  non-depressed comparisons participated in the study. Participants completed a word  list-learning task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS:  In the context of equivalent recall and recognition of words following scanning and  similar hippocampal volumes, patients with LLD exhibited less activation in  structures known to be relevant for new learning and memory, including hippocampus,  parahippocampal gyrus, insula, and cingulate, relative to non-ill comparisons. An  important region in which the LLD group displayed greater activation than the  non-depressed comparison group was in left inferior frontal gyrus, an area involved  in cognitive control and controlled semantic/phonological retrieval and analysis;  this region may be critical for LLD patients to consolidate encoded words into  memory. CONCLUSIONS: Functional irregularities found in LLD patients may reflect  different modes of processing to-be-remembered information and/or early changes  predictive of incipient cognitive decline. Future studies might consider mechanisms  that could contribute to these functional differences, including  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning and vascular integrity, and utilize  longitudinal designs in order to understand whether functional changes are  predictive of incipient cognitive decline.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The proposition that synthetic food colors can induce adverse behavioral effects in children was first enunciated in 1975 by Feingold [Why Your Child Is Hyperactive. New York:Random House (1975)], who asserted that elevated sensitivity to food additives underlies the signs of hyperactivity observed in some children. Although the evidence suggested that some unknown proportion of children did respond to synthetic food colors, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) interpreted the evidence as inconclusive. A study published in 2007 [McCann et al. Food additives and hyperactive behaviour in 3-year-old and 8/9-year-old children in the community: a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Lancet 370:1560-1567 (2007)] drew renewed attention to the hypothesis because of the study's size and scope. It led the FDA to review the evidence, hold a public hearing, and seek the advice of its Food Advisory Committee. In preparation for the hearing, the FDA reviewed the available evidence and concluded that it did not warrant further agency action. OBJECTIVES: In this commentary I examine the basis of the FDA's position, the elements of the review that led to its decision and that of the Food Advisory Committee, and the reasons that this is an environmental health issue. DISCUSSION: The FDA review confined itself, in essence, to the clinical diagnosis of hyperactivity, as did the charge to the committee, rather than asking the broader environmental question of behavioral effects in the general population; it failed to recognize the significance of vulnerable subpopulations; and it misinterpreted the meaning of effect size as a criterion of risk. The FDA's response would have benefited from adopting the viewpoints and perspectives common to environmental health research. At the same time, the food color debate offers a lesson to environmental health researchers; namely, too narrow a focus on a single outcome or criterion can be misleading.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether neurocognitive performance and clinical outcomes can be enhanced by a mindfulness intervention in older adults with stress disorders and  cognitive complaints. To explore decreased hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis  activity as a possible mechanism. METHODS: 103 adults aged 65 years or older with an  anxiety or depressive disorder (diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria) and  subjective neurocognitive difficulties were recruited in St. Louis, Missouri, or San  Diego, California, from September 2012 through August 2013 and randomly assigned in  groups of 5-8 to mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) or a health education  control condition matched for time, attention, and credibility. The primary outcomes  were memory (assessed by immediate and delayed paragraph and list recall) and  cognitive control (Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System Verbal Fluency Test and  Color Word Interference Test). Other outcomes included clinical symptoms (worry,  depression, anxiety, and global improvement). HPA axis activity was assessed using  peak salivary cortisol. Outcomes were measured immediately post-intervention and  (for clinical outcomes only) at 3- and 6-month follow up. RESULTS: On the basis of  intent-to-treat principles using data from all 103 participants, the mindfulness  group experienced greater improvement on a memory composite score (P = .046). Groups  did not differ on change in cognitive control. Participants receiving MBSR also  improved more on measures of worry (P = .042) and depression (P = .049) at  posttreatment and on worry (P = .02), depression (P = .002), and anxiety (P = .002)  at follow-up and were more likely to be rated as much or very much improved as rated  by the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale (47\% vs 27\%, χ² = 4.5, P =  .03). Cortisol level decreased to a greater extent in the mindfulness group, but  only among those participants with high baseline cortisol. CONCLUSIONS: In this  population of older adults with stress disorders and neurocognitive difficulties, a  mindfulness intervention improves clinical outcomes such as excessive worry and  depression and may include some forms of immediate memory performance.

  abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a circuit-oriented treatment for mental disorders. Unfortunately, even well-conducted psychiatric DBS clinical trials have yielded  inconsistent symptom relief, in part because DBS' mechanism(s) of action are  unclear. One clue to those mechanisms may lie in the efficacy of ventral internal  capsule/ventral striatum (VCVS) DBS in both major depression (MDD) and  obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). MDD and OCD both involve deficits in cognitive  control. Cognitive control depends on prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions that project  into the VCVS. Here, we show that VCVS DBS' effect is explained in part by  enhancement of PFC-driven cognitive control. DBS improves human subjects'  performance on a cognitive control task and increases theta (5-8Hz) oscillations in  both medial and lateral PFC. The theta increase predicts subjects' clinical  outcomes. Our results suggest a possible mechanistic approach to DBS therapy, based  on tuning stimulation to optimize these neurophysiologic phenomena.},

Belief ‘choice’ is subject to an important constraint, however: people can only bring themselves to believe things for which they can find rationalizations. When preferences for similar beliefs are widespread, this constraint generates rationalization markets, social structures in which agents compete to produce rationalizations in exchange for money and social rewards. I explore the nature of such markets, I draw on political media to illustrate their characteristics and behaviour, and I highlight their implications for understanding motivated cognition and misinformation.},

Despite mounting attention to the problem of online misinformation and growing agreement that digital literacy efforts are important, prior research offers few concrete ideas about what skilled evaluations look like. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: Our purpose in this study was to seek out those who are skilled in online evaluations in order to understand how their strategies and approaches to evaluating digital content might inform educational efforts. We sampled 45 experienced users of the Internet: 10 Ph.D. historians, 10 professional fact checkers, and 25 Stanford University undergraduates. Analysis focused on the strategies participants used to evaluate online information and arrive at judgments of credibility. Research Design: In this expert/novice study, participants thought aloud as they evaluated live websites and searched for information on social and political issues such as bullying, minimum wage, and teacher tenure. We analyze and present findings from three of the tasks participants completed. Findings/Results: Historians and students often fell victim to easily manipulated features of websites, such as official-looking logos and domain names. They read vertically, staying within a website to evaluate its reliability. In contrast, fact checkers read laterally, leaving a site after a quick scan and opening up new browser tabs in order to judge the credibility of the original site. Compared to the other groups, fact checkers arrived at more warranted conclusions in a fraction of the time. Conclusions/Recommendations: We draw on insights gleaned from the fact checkers' practices to examine current curricular approaches to teaching web credibility as well as to suggest alternatives.},

Nous nous savons tous exposés aux mêmes risques : changement climatique, crise économique et écologique, épidémies, terrorismes, etc. Mais alors qu’elle s’impose dans les consciences, l’unité de l’humanité recule dans les représentations : revendications identitaires, nationalismes, xénophobies, radicalités religieuses. L’universel est accusé de toutes parts : il serait oublieux des particularismes et des différences, en somme il serait trop universel. Ou il ne le serait pas assez, il ne serait que le masque du plus fort : du patriarcat (tous les hommes, mais pas les femmes), de l’Occident (tous les hommes, mais seulement les Blancs), ou de l’anthropocentrisme (tous les hommes, mais pas les animaux). Contre ces replis, il faut que les idées universalistes retrouvent leur puissance mobilisatrice et critique. Contre la dictature des émotions et des opinions, défendre la raison scientifique. Contre l’empire des identités, refonder une éthique de l’égalité et de la réciprocité. Sur quoi peut aujourd’hui reposer cet héritage des Lumières ? Ni sur un Dieu, ni sur la Nature, car ils prouvent tout et son contraire. Il faut s’y résoudre : l’humanité est seule source de valeurs. Pour autant, nous ne sommes pas condamnés au relativisme. Car l’humanité, ce n’est pas seulement l’ensemble des êtres humains, c’est aussi la qualité présente en chacun de nous et qui nous lie aux autres : non pas la capacité de communiquer qui est aussi propre à d’autres espèces, ni l’aptitude à raisonner que possèdent certaines machines, mais la faculté de raisonner en communiquant, autrement dit de dialoguer.

The controversy was initiated by a scientific article about bacteria able to substitute arsenic for phosphorus in its genetic material. We present the debate chronologically, using prominent online media to reconstruct the events. Using tweets that discussed the controversy, we conducted quantitative sentiment analysis to examine skeptical and non-skeptical tones on Twitter. Critiques of and studies refuting the arsenic life hypothesis were publicized on blogs before formal publication in traditional academic spaces and were shared on Twitter, influencing issue salience among a range of audiences. This case exemplifies the role of new media in informal post-publication peer review, which can complement traditional peer review processes. The implications drawn from this case study for future conduct and transparency of both formal and informal peer review are discussed.},

Whether the ability to generate memory strategies exerts an  influence in the performance of memory tests in the elderly population is still a  matter of debate. Here we present results from an experimental memory task (Test of  Memory Strategies, TMS), comprised of five lists of words starting from an  incidental learning task, and four more lists which progressively gain in their  external organization of the material, reducing the necessity of mobilizing complex  memory strategies. TMS has been applied to four groups of elderly patients (amnestic  Mild Cognitive Impairment - aMCI, multidomain (mMCI), and Vascular Cognitive  Impairment - VCI and Depression) and a healthy aging group. In conditions with low  organization of the material, the mMCI and VCI groups (both showing a greater  executive function impairment) have shown lower performance. However, as the  material was progressively organized, they improved their performance. The aMCI  group showed similar performance to the control group at the lower level of external  organization but did not improve performance in conditions with a high level of  external organization. The mMCI and VCI groups showed lower performance on all TMS  conditions compared with controls. Discriminant analysis revealed 90\% sensitivity  and specificity to differentiate between groups based on TMS conditions. These  results indicate how executive functions influence performance on memory tasks in  elderly subjects with different neuropsychological profiles.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Apathy and depression are the most common neuropsychiatric features in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). These syndromes have been linked to cognitive and  functional decline. This study aimed to examine their unique relationships with  specific cognitive abilities and daily functioning among MCI patients with memory  impairment (amnestic MCI). METHODS: Data from 90 individuals referred for outpatient  clinical neuropsychological evaluation and subsequently characterized as having  amnestic MCI were obtained from a memory disorders center. MCI was defined using  current NIA-Alzheimer's Association criteria. Variables included caregiver-reported  apathy (Frontal Systems Behavior Scale) and depression (Memory and Behavioral  Problems Checklist), scores on neuropsychological measures, and the Lawton-Brody  Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale. Data were analyzed with multiple  regressions controlling for age and education. RESULTS: Depression was independently  associated with composite scores of executive functioning. Neither apathy nor  depression was associated with composite scores of attention, memory, or language.  With regard to individual measures of executive functioning, depression was  independently associated with poorer set-shifting (i.e., Trails B). Apathy was  independently associated with poorer letter fluency (i.e., FAS). Apathy, but not  depression, was associated with greater functional impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Apathy  and depression are associated with different aspects of executive functioning in  amnestic MCI, which may reflect differing patterns of frontal lobe pathology. Apathy  exerts a greater impact on daily functioning than depression and may therefore  increase reliance on caregivers. Results support the separability of apathy and  depression in amnestic MCI. Clinicians should differentiate these neuropsychiatric  states during assessment and treatment.},

The oven temperature was programmed at 180°C for 0.5min, with a rise of 15°C up to 250°C. The injector and detector temperature was 300°C. Detection was carried out using Flame Ionization Detector (FID). Methyl paraben was used as an internal standard. The retention times of ibuprofen and paracetamol were (3.681 and 4.089) min respectively. The validation of the method including linearity, range, accuracy, precision, system suitability and robustness was carried out utilizing ICH guidelines. Calibration curves were linear over the range (0.25-1.75)mg/mL for both ibuprofen and paracetamol. The percentage of accuracy for two drugs was found within the acceptance limit of (98–102)\%. The precision study results of the new method were less than the maximum allowable limit percentage of relative standard deviation (\%RSD) ≤ 2.0\%. The proposed method can be easily adopted for the routine analysis of ibuprofen and paracetamol in bulk and pharmaceutical dosage form.},

This study  identified altered functional connectivity (FC) in patients with PSD at the subacute  phase in three brain networks: default mood network (DMN), cognitive control network  (CCN), and affective network (AN). The correlation between FC and the severity of  PSD was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Resting-state functional magnetic  resonance image (rs-fMRI) was performed on 26 PSD patients (6 females), 24 stroke  patients without depression (5 females), and 24 age-matched normal controls (6  females) all aged 40-75 years. The FC values of DMN, CCN, and AN were calculated and  compared among the three groups. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) (17  items) was employed and the score was correlated with FC in the PSD group. RESULTS:  The FCs of the three networks were altered in PSD patients at the subacute phase  compared to stroke patients without depression and normal controls (NC). Moreover,  the left inferior parietal gyrus, the left orbital part of inferior frontal gyrus,  and left angular gyrus (which indicated altered FC) were significantly correlated  with HDRS scores in PSD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Alteration of the three neural  networks might be correlated with the development of PSD at the subacute phase of  stroke.},

Glial cell  line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a neurotrophic factor from the  transforming growth factor-β family that plays a role in the development and  function of the brain. This study aimed to test whether GDNF in serum was abnormal  in MDD, and whether it was related to the cognitive impairment of MDD. METHODS:  Serum GDNF levels in MDD patients (n\,=\,32) and normal controls (n\,=\,32) were  measured with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. All subjects were  assessed for performance on the Wisconsin card-sorting test (WCST). RESULTS:  Performance on the WCST in MDD patients was significantly poorer than that in  controls. Serum GDNF levels in MDD patients were significantly decreased compared to  that of the control subjects (P\,{$<$}\,0.001). Furthermore, the decrease in the serum  GDNF levels positively correlated with performance in the WCST-\% CONC and negatively  with performance in the WCST-P in MDD patients. DISCUSSION: The findings suggest  that MDD patients have extensive impairments of executive functioning, and lower  serum GDNF might be involved in the pathogenesis of MDD, which may be associated  with the cognitive dysfunction in MDD patients.},

  abstract = {As people’s health awareness and standard of living improve, mHealth applications are being increasingly used. However, mHealth application services are mainly based on the collection of personal and behavioral data, which conflicts with users’ growing privacy concerns. In that context, this study considers the privacy paradox phenomenon, in which privacy concerns co-exist with disclosure behavior. This study explores the privacy paradox in mHealth applications using an integrated elaboration likelihood model (ELM) from the perspective of privacy calculus and privacy fatigue. Results from the quasi-experiment and partial least squares structural equation modeling reveal that, compared with privacy concerns, perceived benefits have a greater impact on users’ disclosure intention, which further supports the existence of the privacy paradox in the mHealth context; this process is found to originate in users’ privacy calculus. However, privacy fatigue is found to have an insignificant impact on users’ disclosure intention, which may be due to the low sunk cost of users’ investment in mHealth applications. The results indicate that designers of mHealth applications should optimize their interaction functions to enhance benefits to users.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Although electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is considered a safe and highly effective treatment option for major depressive disorder, there are still some  reservations with regard to possible adverse cognitive adverse effects. This is the  case despite a large body of evidence showing that these deficits are transient and  that there even seems to be a long-term improvement of cognitive functioning level.  However, most data concerning cognitive adverse effects stem from studies using  mixed samples of treatment-resistant and non-treatment-resistant as well as  ECT-naive and non-ECT-naive subjects. Furthermore, neurocognitive measures might  partly be sensitive to practice effects and improvements in depressive symptom  level. METHODS: We examined neurocognitive performance in a sample of 20  treatment-resistant and ECT-naive subjects using repeatable neurocognitive tests,  whereas changes in depressive symptom level were controlled. Cognitive functioning  level was assessed before (baseline), 1 week, and 6 months (follow-up 1 and 2) after  (12 to) 15 sessions of unilateral ECT treatment. RESULTS: No adverse cognitive  effects were observed in any of the cognitive domains examined. Instead, a  significant improvement in verbal working memory performance was found from baseline  to follow-up 2. When changes in depressive symptom levels were controlled  statistically, this improvement was no longer seen. CONCLUSIONS: Although findings  that ECT does not lead to longer lasting cognitive deficits caused by ECT were  confirmed, our study adds evidence that previous results of a beneficial effect of  ECT on cognition might be questioned.},

  abstract = {The concept of "mild cognitive impairment" (MCI) refers to alterations in cognition in the transition between normal aging and dementia. However, from a  neuropsychological point of view the conventional diagnostic criteria appear not  sufficiently valid. In particular, it is still difficult to differentiate between  subjects with MCI and subjects with depression plus cognitive deficits on the basis  of their neuropsychological profiles. The aim of this study is to compare cognitive  deficit patterns of subjects with MCI and with depression. 24 subjects with MCI, 50  subjects with depression (DEP) and 20 healthy control subjects were included (age:  55-74years). The neuropsychological assessment consisted of standardized tests to  assess attention, memory, and executive functions. Compared to healthy controls both  subject groups showed significantly lower performance in all cognitive domains.  However, we did not find significant differences in cognitive performance between  MCI and DEP subjects, neither at baseline nor at follow-up. In addition, preliminary  results of follow-up assessments after 2 (DEP) and 6months (MCI), respectively,  revealed no significant changes in cognition in subjects with depression, regardless  of whether depressive symptoms had improved. Subjects with MCI also showed no  changes in cognition at follow-up. The comparable neuropsychological patterns  identified in the two subject groups may be understood as a consequence of similar  alterations in cognitive systems, supporting the idea of a final common pathway  disorder. Thus, the cognitive deficits present in a subgroup of subjects with  depression may possibly better be understood in the context of MCI.},

This hypothesis was taken up by the lay press and led to concerns among doctors and patients whether the use of these drugs was still safe and justified against the background of the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2 with an increasing number of cases and deaths. In this article, we summarize what is known about the effect of RAS blockers or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on the course of COVID-19 disease. In the case of RAS inhibition, we also find evidence for the opposite hypothesis, namely, that RAS inhibition in COVID-19 could be protective. In view of the inconsistent and limited evidence and after weighing up the benefits and risks, we would not currently recommend discontinuing or switching an effective treatment with RAS blockers. NSAIDs should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible period. The choice of drug to treat COVID-19-associated fever or pain should be based on a benefit-risk assessment for known side effects (e.g., kidney damage, gastrointestinal ulceration).},

This study evaluated the association of general depressive symptoms and motivational-related  symptoms with cognitive impairment 6 years later and to explore the role of  potential underlying mechanisms. In 2690 cognitively healthy persons aged ≥60 from  the Swedish National study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC-K) depressive  symptoms were derived from the Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).  Cognitive performance was assessed at baseline and 6 years later in 1810 persons  with the Mini Mental State Examination (global cognition), Digit Span Forward  (short-term memory), Digit Span Backward (working memory), Clock-test (visuospatial  construction), and the 5-item test (immediate and delayed recall). Bi-factor  analysis on the MADRS yielded a General Depression factor and an unrelated  Motivational factor. After adjusting for demographics, the General Depression factor  was only associated with 6-year impairment in delayed recall (OR (95\% CI): 1.18  (1.04-1.34)). This association was no longer significant after adjusting for  demographics, cardiovascular risk, lifestyle factors and medication use. The  Motivational factor was not significantly associated with future cognitive  impairments after adjusting for demographics. Concluding, almost all associations of  general depressive symptoms and motivational-related symptoms with future cognitive  impairments appeared to be confounded by demographics. Only the association of  general depressive symptoms with future memory impairments appeared to be explained  by a combination of demographics, cardiovascular risk, lifestyle and medication use.},
