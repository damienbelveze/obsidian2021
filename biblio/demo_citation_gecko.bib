  abstract = {Color additives are important for the food industry to improve sensory quality lost during food process and to expand the variety of products. In general, artificial colorants have lower cost and better stability than the natural ones. Nevertheless, studies have reported their association with some health disorders. Furthermore, consumers have given greater attention to food products with health beneficial effects, which has provided a new perspective for the use of natural colorants. In this context, fruits are an excellent alternative source of natural compounds, that allow the obtainment of a wide range of colorant molecules, such as anthocyanins, betalains, carotenoids, and chlorophylls. Furthermore, in addition to their coloring ability, they comprise different bioactive properties. However, the extraction and application of natural colorants from fruits is still a challenge, since these compounds show some stability problems, in addition to issues related to the sustainability of raw-materials providing. To overcome these limitations, several studies have reported optimized extraction and stabilization procedures. In this review, the major pigments found in fruits and their extraction and stabilization techniques for uses as food additives will be looked over.},

  abstract = {Autism has been increasing dramatically since its description by Leo Kanner in 1943. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2018 has identified 1 in 59 children (1 in 37 boys and 1 in 151 girls) has autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Autistic spectrum disorders and ADHD are complex conditions in which nutritional and environmental factors play major roles. It is important to understand how food can have an impact on their current and future health. Appealing food colors stimulate the consumption of different food products. Since 2011, it is evident that dyes are linked to harmful effects in children. Artificial dyes have neurotoxic chemicals that aggravate mental health problems. Many families with autistic children avoid food dyes in their diet in order to avoid behavioral issues. A study reported that there is a correlation between yellow dye and sleep disturbance. Food colors Blue 1 and 2, Green 3, Red 3, Yellow 5 and 6, Citrus Red 2, and Red 40 can trigger many behaviors in most kids. Artificial food color usually contains petroleum and is manufactured in a chemical process that includes formaldehyde, aniline, hydroxides, and sulfuric acids. Most impurities in the food color are in the form of salts or acids. Sometimes lead, arsenic, and mercury may be present as impurities. The U.S. FDA is yet to study the effects of synthetic dyes on behavior in children. A study conducted at Southampton University in England found a link between food dyes and hyperactive behavior in children. The research does not prove that food coloring actually causes autism spectrum disorder, but there seems to be a link. This chapter attempts to provide a broad review of the available literature on food color and the epidemiology, etiology, prevention, and treatment of autistic spectrum disorder.},

  abstract = {Key points{$<$}list id="tjp6378-list-0001" list-type="bulleted"{$>$} Hyperactivity of the stress system and low-grade immune activation characterize the functional bowel disorder irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). These studies show that interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 and the stress hormone corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), present in IBS plasma, have functional effects on gastrointestinal activity by stimulating myenteric neurons and colonic contractions. Moreover, in the Wistar Kyoto rat model of IBS, which exhibits altered gastrointestinal motility and visceral pain sensitivity, blocking IL-6 and/or CRF1 receptors alleviates these IBS-like symptoms. Underlying these effects are altered colonic protein expression of tight junction proteins which regulate gut barrier function and the T-type calcium channel Ca(V)3.2, which has been linked to visceral pain. These findings demonstrate the importance of the enteric nervous system and intestinal physiology in bowel dysfunction. AbstractThe search for effective therapeutic strategies for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is hampered by an incomplete understanding of its underlying pathophysiology. Stress and altered plasma cytokine profiles indicative of immune activation are characteristic of the disorder. The neuromodulatory effects of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and corticotropin-releasing factor receptor (CRFR) 1 in visceral pain and stress-induced defecation in the Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rat model of IBS were investigated. Sprague Dawley and WKY rats were administered anti-IL-6 receptor antibodies (xIL-6R, 0.5mgkg(-1) i.p) with or without the CRFR1 antagonist antalarmin (10mgkg(-1) i.p). Post-intervention, the pain threshold to colorectal distension and stress-induced faecal output were compared and changes in colonic mucosal protein expression were investigated. The neuro-stimulatory effects of IBS plasma on the myenteric plexus is mediated by IL-6, IL-8 and CRF. The stimulatory effects of these soluble factors on myenteric neuron excitability and colonic contractility were additive. Moreover, inhibition of IL-6 and CRF1 receptors in vivo in the WKY IBS rat model normalized stress-induced defecation (P{$<$}0.01) and visceral pain sensitivity (P{$<$}0.001) with associated changes in protein expression of the tight junction proteins occludin and claudin 2, the visceral pain-associated T-type calcium channel Ca(V)3.2 and intracellular signalling molecules STAT3, SOCS3 and ERK1/2. These studies demonstrate the additive effects of immune and stress factors on myenteric neuronal excitability. Moreover, combined targeting of peripheral IL-6 and CRF1 receptors is effective in alleviating IBS-like symptoms in the WKY rat. Thus, crosstalk between stress and immune factors during IBS flares may underlie symptom exacerbation.},

N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nACHRs) are thought to be effective in the learning and memory-generating process. In this study, we investigated the effects of intrauterine exposure to AFCAs on subunit concentrations of NMDARs and nAChRs isoforms in rats. We administered a mixture of AFCAs (Eritrosin, Ponceau 4R, Allura Red AC, Sunset Yellow FCF, Tartrazin, Amaranth, Brilliant Blue, Azoruhin and Indigotin) to female rats before and during gestation. The concentration of NR2A and NR2B subunits and nAChR alpha 7, alpha 4 beta 2 isoforms in their offspring's hippocampi were measured by Western Blotting. Expressions of NR2B and nAChR beta 2 were significantly increased (17\% and 6.70\%, respectively), whereas expression of nAChR alpha 4 was significantly decreased (5.67\%) in male experimental group compared to the male control group (p {$<$} 0.05). In the female experimental group, AFCAs caused a 14\% decrease in NR2B expression when compared to the female control group (p {$<$} 0.05). Our results indicate that exposure to AFCAs during the fetal period may lead to alterations in expressions of NMDARs and nAChRs in adulthood. These alterations were different between male and female genders. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Nowadays more and more attentions are paid to fruit quality in the production of tomato. In order to better understand the effects of deficit irrigation on tomato yield and fruit quality, four years of deficit irrigation experiments were investigated to simulate water-yield and water-fruit quality relationships of tomato in greenhouses. The yield and fruit quality parameters like total soluble solids (TSS), reducing sugars (RS), organic acids (OA), sugar/acid content ratio (SAR), vitamin C (VC), firmness (Fn), color index (CI) were correlated with seasonal evapotranspiration (ET) and ET deficit at flowering and fruit development stage (Stage II) and fruit ripening stage (Stage III) using linear regression. Three water-yield models (Jensen, Stewart, Minhas) and three water-fruit quality models (multiplicative, additive, exponential) were applied to simulate the relationships of tomato yield and fruit quality parameters with water deficit at various growth stages. The water deficit sensitivity indexes (lambda/Ky/delta or gamma/Kq/psi) of the models were calculated with the method of multiply linear regression. The performance and sensitivity analysis of the models were evaluated. Results showed that the relative yield decreased linearly with the drop of relative seasonal ET, mainly due to the yield depression by ET deficit at Stage Hand Stage III; the relative values of fruit quality parameters increased with the drop of relative seasonal ET, mostly because of the enhancement by ET deficit at Stage III. The calculated water deficit sensitivity indexes indicated that both the yield and fruit quality were hardly sensitive to water deficit at Stage I, but sensitive to water deficit at Stage II and that at Stage III; TSS, RS, SAR and VC were much more sensitive to water deficit at Stage III than that at Stage II; RS, SAR and VC were more sensitive to water deficit than TSS, OA, Fn and CI. The Minhas model with its water deficit sensitivity indexes was recommended to simulate wateryield relations of greenhouse tomato in the study area; multiplicative model and additive model were, respectively, recommended to simulate the relationships of fruit quality parameters like TSS, RS, SAR, Fn and fruit quality parameters like OA, VC, CI with water deficit at various growth stages. The water-yield and water-fruit quality models would be helpful to optimally allocate irrigation water during the growth season, thus achieving efficient production of tomato in greenhouses in consideration of the compromise between tomato yield and fruit quality.

The novel strain Pediococcus pentosaceus GS4 has been reported for probiotic, survivability in simulated gastrointestinal fluid, and antioxidative and biohydrogenation properties. Therefore, we hypothesize that this specific strain might be able to assuage the effect of azoxymethane (AOM)-induced toxicity in mice. Twenty-eight Swiss albino mice were divided into 4 groups and were studied for-32 weeks. Azoxymethane (10 mg/kg body weight) was administered intraperitoneally twice (Oth and 14th days), and probiotic GS4 (1.1 x 10(9) colony-forming unit/mL) was given orally for the respective groups. Mice who served as the normal control received only normal saline. GS4-intervened AOM-induced mice showed marked improvement at the histopathologic level, in the liver and kidney. Moreover, probiotic GS4 intervention in AOM-induced mice exhibited a significant reduction in the liver function biomarker when compared with the AOM-induced mice. Probiotic GS4 intervention reduced the intestinal structural deformities as evident from the elevated brush border membrane-associated disaccharidases (sucrase, lactase) and intestinal alkaline phosphatase activities, which were found disrupted by AOM intoxication. Fecal bacterial load was found to be reduced in AOM-induced mice which were subsequently replenished by the probiotic GS4 intervention as apparent from the enhanced fecal bacterial load. There were no adverse effects observed in the probiotic control group. Conclusively, novel probiotic strain GS4 exhibited safe and beneficial effects against the toxicity threats posed by AOM. Thus, GS4 could be considered as a potential food supplement/additive for therapeutic purposes in gastrointestinal disorders related to inflammation and cancer. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

A wealth of data pointed out that various aspects of chronic inflammation may be affected by several specific dietary factors. This paper calls attention to anthocyanins enriched plant food and anthocyanin dietary supplements, whose role in the management of IBD and its associated oncogenesis deems crucial. Area covered: We updated the most relevant dietary anthocyanins with potential anti-colitis and preventive effect on inflammatory associated colorectal cancer based on the recent animal and human researches along with revealing the major cellular and molecular mechanisms of action. Mounting evidence reported that anthocyanins enriched plant foods perform their protective role on IBD and inflammatory-induced colorectal cancer via different cellular transduction signaling pathways, including inflammatory transcription factors, SAPK/JNK and p38 MAPK cascade, JAK/STAT signaling, NF-kB/pERK/MAPK, Wnt signaling pathway, Nrf2 cytoprotective pathway as well as AMPK pathway and autophagy. Expert commentary: Combination of anthocyanins enriched dietary supplements with existing medications can provide new therapeutic options for IBD patients. Further, well-designed randomized control trials (RCTs) are essential to evaluate the role of anthocyanins enriched medicinal foods as well as isolated anthocyanin components as promising preventive and therapeutic dietary agents for IBD and its associated oncogenesis.},

  abstract = {Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common behavioral disorders in children. Symptoms of ADHD include hyperactivity, low frustration tolerance, impulsivity, and inattention. While the biological pathways leading to ADHD are not clearly delineated, a number of genetic and environmental risk factors for the disorder are recognized. In the early 1970s, research conducted by Dr. Benjamin Feingold found that when hyperactive children were given a diet free of artificial food additives and dyes, symptoms of hyperactivity were reduced. While some clinical studies supported these findings, more rigorous empirical studies conducted over the next 20 years were less positive. As a result, research on the role of food additives in contributing to ADHD waned. In recent years, however, interest in this area has revived. In response to more recent research and public petitions, in December 2009 the British government requested that food manufacturers remove most artificial food dyes from their products. While these strictures could have positive effects on behavior, the removal of food dyes is not a panacea for ADHD, which is a multifaceted disorder with both biological and environmental underpinnings.},

This pilot study examined the effects of AFC on ADHD symptoms and electroencephalography (EEG) in college students with and without ADHD. Methods: At baseline, control and ADHD participants completed the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS), simple and complex attention measures, and resting-state EEG recordings. ADHD participants (n = 18) and a subset of controls (extended control group or EC, n = 11) avoided AFC in their diet for 2 weeks and then were randomized to a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover challenge. Subjects received either 225 mg AFC disguised in chocolate cookies or placebo chocolate cookies for 3 days each week, with testing on the third day each week. Baseline comparisons were made using Student's t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum tests and challenge period analyses were run using General Linear Modeling. Results: The ADHD group had significantly greater scores on the ASRS (p {$<$} 0.001), confirming a symptom differential between groups; however, there were no differences in attentional measures or EEG at baseline. The AFC challenge resulted in an increase in posterior mean gamma power (p = 0.05), a decrease in posterior relative alpha power (p = 0.04), and a marginal increase in inattentive symptoms (p = 0.08) in the ADHD group. There were no effects of AFC in the EC group. Discussion: This study indicates that AFC exposure may affect brainwave activity and ADHD symptoms in college students with ADHD. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.},

Two behavior scores were used including the strengths and weaknesses of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and normal behavior rating scale and the child behavior checklist-teacher report form. Results: Capsule A containing AFCs and Capsule B containing sodium benzoate had no significant adverse effect compared with placebo in both behavior scores.

This study was designed to assess the awareness and perception of coloring agents present in food and beverages on children's behavior among people of Jazan, Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional study was conducted on representative samples of 387 married people from different places in Jazan region of Saudi Arabia from August to December 2019. The study utilized a validated questionnaire consisting of 12 questions to gather the information from 387 participants (52.9\% males and 47.03\% females). Approximately 77\% were young adults; belong to age group of 26-45 years (P = 0.000). Majority (40.5\%) of them had four or more children (P = 0.000). While significant level of knowledge about the use of foods and beverages containing coloring agent was found in the participants (P = 0.001), they were not aware that it may affect the child's health. Only 24.7\% were able to tell the name of a coloring agent (P = 0.001). Significant percentage (88.9\%) of parents reported about child hyperactivity after consumption of specific type of food and beverages, particularly fizzy drinks (35.61\%), chocolates (31.82\%), and sweets and candy (30.3\%). Target populations were considered to be aware of presence of coloring agent in food and beverages used by their children regularly but they are not much aware of its harmful effect on long-term use.},

  abstract = {Food additives have been used throughout history to perform specific functions in foods. A comprehensive framework of legislation is in place within Europe to control the use of additives in the food supply and ensure they pose no risk to human health. Further to this, exposure assessments are regularly carried out to monitor population intakes and verify that intakes are not above acceptable levels (acceptable daily intakes). Young children may have a higher dietary exposure to chemicals than adults due to a combination of rapid growth rates and distinct food intake patterns. For this reason, exposure assessments are particularly important in this age group. The paper will review the use of additives and exposure assessment methods and examine factors that affect dietary exposure by young children. One of the most widely investigated unfavourable health effects associated with food additive intake in preschool-aged children are suggested adverse behavioural effects. Research that has examined this relationship has reported a variety of responses, with many noting an increase in hyperactivity as reported by parents but not when assessed using objective examiners. This review has examined the experimental approaches used in such studies and suggests that efforts are needed to standardise objective methods of measuring behaviour in preschool children. Further to this, a more holistic approach to examining food additive intakes by preschool children is advisable, where overall exposure is considered rather than focusing solely on behavioural effects and possibly examining intakes of food additives other than food colours.},

Processing speed was evaluated with prior prescription medication, without medication after a 2-day period off ADHD medication, and with low-dose (10/20mg) and high-dose (20/40mg) methylphenidate hydrochloride (Medikinet IR).Results: Thirty-three participants responded to the experimental treatments. One-way ANOVA with post-hoc analysis (Scheffe) indicated significant main effects for single dimension colour and form and dual-dimension colour-form naming. Post-hoc analysis indicated statistical differences between the no- and high-dose medication conditions for colour and form, measures of perceptual speed. For colour-form naming, a measure of cognitive speed, there was a significant difference between no- and low-dose medication and between no- and high-dose medications, but not between low- and high-dose medications.Conclusions: Results indicated that the AQT tests effectively monitored incremental effects of the methylphenidate dose on processing speed after a 2-day period off medication. Thus, perceptual (colour and form) and cognitive speed (two-dimensional colour-form naming) and processing efficiency (lowered shift costs) increased measurably with high-dose medication. These preliminary findings warrant validation with added measures of associated behavioural and cognitive changes.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The role of diet and of food colors in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or its symptoms warrants updated quantitative meta-analysis, in light of recent divergent policy in Europe and the United States. METHOD: Studies were identified through a literature search using the PubMed, Cochrane Library, and PsycNET databases through February 2011. Twenty-four publications met inclusion criteria for synthetic food colors; 10 additional studies informed analysis of dietary restriction. A random-effects meta-analytic model generated summary effect sizes. RESULTS: Restriction diets reduced ADHD symptoms at an effect of g = 0.29 (95\% CI, 0.07-0.53). For food colors, parent reports yielded an effect size of g = 0.18 (95\% CI, 0.08-0.24; p = .0007), which decreased to 0.12 (95\% CI, 0.01-0.23; p {$<$} .05) after adjustment for possible publication bias. The effect was reliable in studies restricted to food color additives (g = 0.21, 95\% CI = 0.06-0.36) but did not survive correction for possible publication bias and was not reliable in studies confined to Food and Drug Administration-approved food colors. Teacher/observer reports yielded a nonsignificant effect of 0.07 (95\% CI = -0.03 to 0.18; p = .14). However, high-quality studies confined to color additives yielded a reliable effect (g = 0.22, 95\% CI = 0.10-0.41, p = .030) that survived correction. In psychometric tests of attention, the summary effect size was 0.27 (95\% CI = 0.07-0.47; p = .007) and survived correction. An estimated 8\% of children with ADHD may have symptoms related to synthetic food colors. CONCLUSIONS: A restriction diet benefits some children with ADHD. Effects of food colors were notable were but susceptible to publication bias or were derived from small, nongeneralizable samples. Renewed investigation of diet and ADHD is warranted.},

  abstract = {Plant beneficial microbes (PBMs), such as plant growth-promoting bacteria, rhizobia, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and Trichoderma, can reduce the use of agrochemicals and increase plant yield, nutrition, and tolerance to biotic-abiotic stresses. Yet, large-scale applications of PBM have been hampered by the high amounts of inoculum per plant or per cultivation area needed for successful colonization and consequently the economic feasibility. Seed coating, a process that consists in covering seeds with low amounts of exogenous materials, is gaining attention as an efficient delivery system for PBM. Microbial seed coating comprises the use of a binder, in some cases a filler, mixed with inocula, and can be done using simple mixing equipment (e.g., cement mixer) or more specialized/sophisticated apparatus (e.g., fluidized bed). Binders/fillers can be used to extend microbial survival. The most reported types of seed coating are seed dressing, film coating, and pelleting. Tested in more than 50 plant species with seeds of different dimensions, forms, textures, and germination types (e.g., cereals, vegetables, fruits, pulses, and other legumes), seed coating has been studied using various species of plant growth-promoting bacteria, rhizobia, Trichoderma, and to a lesser extent mycorrhizal fungi. Most of the studies regarding PBM applied via seed coating are aimed at promoting crop growth, yield, and crop protection against pathogens. Studies have shown that coating seeds with PBM can assist crops in improving seedling establishment and germination or achieving high yields and food quality, under reduced chemical fertilization. The right combination of biological control agents applied via seed coating can be a powerful tool against a wide number of diseases and pathogens. Less frequently, studies report seed coating being used for adaptation and protection of crops under abiotic stresses. Notwithstanding the promising results, there are still challenges mainly related with the scaling up from the laboratory to the field and proper formulation, including efficient microbial combinations and coating materials that can result in extended shelf-life of both seeds and coated PBM. These limitations need to be addressed and overcome in order to allow a wider use of seed coating as a cost-effective delivery method for PBM in sustainable agricultural systems.},

Tartrazine has the potential to cause an adverse health effect on humans, such as hyperactivity in children, allergy, and asthma. Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additive and EU Scientific Committee for Food have standardized the acceptable daily intake for tartrazine that is 7.5 mg kg(-1) body weight. Many researchers have detected the presence of tartrazine for monitoring the quality and safety of food products. In this review paper, we highlighted various tartrazine detection and extraction methods. Some of the analytical methods are available such as high-performance liquid chromatography, electrochemical sensor, thin-layer chromatography, spectrophotometry, capillary electrophoresis, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Also, we discuss following extraction steps: liquid-liquid extraction, solid-phase extraction, membrane filtration, cloud point extraction, and other extraction method. In addition, a brief overview is presented explaining the synthesis process and metabolism of tartrazine and the maximum permitted level in different countries. This review paper will give an insight into different extraction and analytical methods for the determination of tartrazine in healthy foods, which will attract the attention of public toward food safety and quality, and also the interest of food industry and government bodies.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The occurrence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has significantly increased in the last few years. One of the common problems in this group are eating disorders and ailments from the gastrointestinal systems. According to some studies, these problems have a significant impact on the occurrence and severity of symptoms in the neurological system, so it is crucial to increase the attention paid on the role of diet in the treatment of this disease. One of the theories connects ASD with disorders of the digestive system and the intestinal bacterial flora. This theory is based on the gut-brain axis, which means the interaction between the gastrointestinal and nervous systems. Objectives: To demonstrate the differences in behavior habits, interest in nutrition, and frequency of consumption of food products between children suffering from ASD and healthy children. Materials and methods: The study was conducted among 44 children suffering from ASD and 33 healthy children as a control group. Data were collected using a questionnaire that was specially designed for this study. The questionnaire contained questions about eating habits and the frequency of consumption of selected food products. Results: Parents of healthy children showed more interest in their children's way of feeding and nutritional recommendations compared to parents of children with ASD (4\% and 11.3\%, respectively). In addition, 24.3\% more children with ASD consulted with a nutritionist compared to the control group. Complaints of the digestive system were 21.1\% more likely by children with ASD. Children suffering from ASD were characterized by a higher intake of red meat and giblets and less frequent consumption of milk and milk products compared to the control group. There were no statistically significant differences between the study group and the control group in terms of frequency of consumption of products, which are the source of gluten, artificial food additives-preservatives, and artificial colors. Conclusions: There are differences in the habits and eating behaviors and the frequency of consumption of selected food products between a group of children with ASD and a group of healthy children.},

Oligoantigenic diet studies suggested that some children in addition to being sensitive to AFCs are also sensitive to common nonsalicylate foods (milk, chocolate, soy, eggs, wheat, corn, legumes) as well as salicylate-containing grapes, tomatoes, and orange. Some studies found "cosensitivity" to be more the rule than the exception. Recently, 2 large studies demonstrated behavioral sensitivity to AFCs and benzoate in children both with and without ADHD. A trial elimination diet is appropriate for children who have not responded satisfactorily to conventional treatment or whose parents wish to pursue a dietary investigation.},

Children with ADHD show excess inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Studies have shown that a subgroup of children (with or without ADHD) react adversely to challenges with AFCs. Many early studies found few children who reacted to challenges with 20-40\,mg of AFCs. However, studies using at least 50\,mg of AFCs showed a greater percentage of children who reacted to the challenge. Three types of potential mechanisms are explored: toxicological, antinutritional, and hypersensitivity. Suggestions for future studies in animals and/or children include dose studies as well as studies to determine the effects of AFCs on the immune system, the intestinal mucosa, and nutrient absorption. Given the potential negative behavioral effects of AFCs, it is important to determine why some children may be more sensitive to AFCs than others and to identify the tolerable upper limits of exposure for children in general and for children at high risk.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The proposition that synthetic food colors can induce adverse behavioral effects in children was first enunciated in 1975 by Feingold [Why Your Child Is Hyperactive. New York:Random House (1975)], who asserted that elevated sensitivity to food additives underlies the signs of hyperactivity observed in some children. Although the evidence suggested that some unknown proportion of children did respond to synthetic food colors, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) interpreted the evidence as inconclusive. A study published in 2007 [McCann et al. Food additives and hyperactive behaviour in 3-year-old and 8/9-year-old children in the community: a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Lancet 370:1560-1567 (2007)] drew renewed attention to the hypothesis because of the study's size and scope. It led the FDA to review the evidence, hold a public hearing, and seek the advice of its Food Advisory Committee. In preparation for the hearing, the FDA reviewed the available evidence and concluded that it did not warrant further agency action. OBJECTIVES: In this commentary I examine the basis of the FDA's position, the elements of the review that led to its decision and that of the Food Advisory Committee, and the reasons that this is an environmental health issue. DISCUSSION: The FDA review confined itself, in essence, to the clinical diagnosis of hyperactivity, as did the charge to the committee, rather than asking the broader environmental question of behavioral effects in the general population; it failed to recognize the significance of vulnerable subpopulations; and it misinterpreted the meaning of effect size as a criterion of risk. The FDA's response would have benefited from adopting the viewpoints and perspectives common to environmental health research. At the same time, the food color debate offers a lesson to environmental health researchers; namely, too narrow a focus on a single outcome or criterion can be misleading.},
