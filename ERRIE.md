Diapason 


# first présentation

I train graduate and undergraduate students to assess information. Until recently, my colleagues and I have spend much time teaching students how to distinguish a paper written by a science journalist from a peer reviewed article. We have been insisting on formal characteristics such as inline citations, bibliography, footnotes, graphic plots. 
But this approach has shown its limits: 
1. a lot of papers that shows an academic design are not actually scientific papers
2. The rise of open access predatory publishing and on the other side, during the COVID-19 crisis the rapid growth of preprints and their use by physicians and decision lead us to spend more time on how scholarly communication should work and how it works actually. 

political use of scientific information can generate safe regulations on the benefit of the public, but a certain kind of science can also be weaponized by industrial stakeholders who want to convince -sometimes against scientific evidence- that their products are harmless. 

There is a large debate on social networks about how one can define expertise : is it the same thing as authority (see [[autorité#autorité et expertise]])
Do authority has inherent qualities, not depending from a given context (ACRL framework states that authority is constructed and contextual)
all along her career, an engineer or a physician may cumulate a great deal of expertise on some topics, but with students we must be sometimes reductionists and consider that in the public debate peer-reviewed academic works offer the most garanties that the guy or girl who is talking knows a bit about what she is talking about. 

In our training sessions, most of the time (not always) an expert on a topic is someone who has written several peer-reveiwed academic works on this topic, someone who comply with the standard way of producing, validating and communicating output. For instance, if the conversation comes to zoology, an expert will be a person who have written several papers in reknown peer-reviewed journals (in some fields, reknown still means, which has or had an impact factor, whatever it be)

When we believe something accordingly to our values, most of the time we need to convince ourselves that scientific research is aligned with our beliefs and our values. We go in search of rationalization. 
One problem is that many people do not see anymore science as a method to reduce uncertainty and widen our knowledge but as a pool of rationalizations. 

If there is a demand for rationalizations, opportunistic misinformers will respond to it (Kahan)

what is an expert ?
What is a peer-review journal ?



# second présentation

University Librarians have always been involved in training students to find reliable sources and assess information, particularly since this information come to them across social networks or websites[[@ACRLFrameworkInformationLiteracy2015]].
Soon after the Trump election, the "Fake news" issue became central in the public debate, and Universities decided to oppose good science against an alledged rise of rumors on the internet and fake news. 
Now we are all conscious that rumors and fake news have been spreading long ago before Facebook and Twitter, and that thanks to works like Dominique Cardon's, the amount of disinformation is not as spectacular as what one can read in the news, but we know also that information wars can cost an election and social networks can be weaponized in an international conflict as the one which opposes Russia to Ukraine.

In courses where we used to teach undergraduates students to distinguish different shades of science (from the academic paper to the amateur's opinion, through disputes on Wikipedia or pubpeer), we tried to incorporate contents about mis or dis-information in the non-scientific media.

Focusing on social networks is the easiest part, because disinformation is traceable and we usually do not have enough time to explain how main media outlets are often economical biased. 
We usually present fragmented information to our students (a tweet for instance) and ask them to reframe and contextualize the claim.
We teach students to practice what it's called "lateral reading" : do not focus too much on the website, but make queries about the source & and the event to check if it has been covered by other sources, or if other sources we consider as reliable say something usefull about the author of the claim. This pedagogy is adapted to the hypertextual nature of the web and derived from constructivist tools.

Sometimes, when the claim is too recent to have been covered (or the source mostly unknown), we have to focus our attention on what is presented to us as evidence supporting a claim. Most of the time, it is an image, a photograph post on Facebook or Twitter. 
The most successful tweets contain emotional content such as pictures causing anger and indignation. 
Information literacy includes skill but also habits and soft skills such as stopping before sharing and checking one's emotions. 
with simple tests, such as the Wason test, we aim at making students aware of the heuristics they mobilize to solve problems and focus on the confirmation bias that can lead to rationalization and motivated reasoning.

As opposed to "deep fakes" which demand programming skills that are still rare in the society, we study with our students how iconographic documents (sometimes videos but mostly photographs) are separated from their original context of publication to be reframed and spread on social networks as "cheep fake", disinformation content, easily edited and posted, for the benefit of quacks, firms, political leagues or authorities.

The notion of expertise (and authority) is a problematic concept. The ALA framework states that "authority is constructed and contextual", which means that it has few intrinsic characteristics, but we try to link a degree of expertise between a field of knowledge (delimited by the topic on which an author has written) while taking into account that in some disciplines, academic papers, especially published in impact factor journals inspire more confidence than books. Most of the time, "Merchants of doubts"(Conway, Oreskes) publish in channels that are not fully recognized by authentic experts in a field.

One question to Vincent Clavaud : 

does he think that fake labs (workshops in which students would try to forge fake pics or deep fakes) would be a good idea to make them aware of the problem of fake news (how it has become easy to forge thorough fake news) ?

Are there already tools, not reserved to savvy users, that can be used to detect deep fakes ?


One question to Julien Giry

journalists and politicians who comment the news talk a lot about conspirationism. There are obvious signs that a lot of people on social network have adopted, during the pandemic, a conspirationnist mindset, but there is a danger to let a partisan use of the term conspirationnism spread among the public to disqualify relevant critics of the power system. Where are the safeguards in the handling of this concept?

# Recognize and avoid fake news in an academic context, engage the general public without being misquoted

JJO

Introduction: 

Fake news or “Infox” in French, is a pretty recent term. While we all seem to know today what this term means, we experience it in our daily lives, on social media, etc., what does it mean exactly in an academic context? The aim of this round table is to help you, as post-doctoral researchers, to safely publish your research and attract wider audiences while avoiding the pitfalls of fake news and conspiracy theories. 

Together, with Julien Le Bonheur, Head of Science Communications at Université de Rennes 1, we are delighted to introduce Damien Belveze, Université de Rennes 1 Librarian and User Trainer, and Vincent Claveau, CNRS Researcher and Computer Scientist, and Julien Giry, Research Fellow, Tours University, PRIM. 

JLB

Mrs Frédérique Vidal, the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research declared in April 2021: “ communication between researchers and the French people is marred with confusion, relativism, and mistrust.” But how critical is the situation exactly? At the 2021 Science & You Conference, which brought together all kind of academics, and among them many science communications and outreach professionals, we were presented with the latest edition of “The French and Science 2021”, a nationwide survey. As you can see, the majority of the general public still widely trusted the scientific community in 2020.

So it seems that the context isn’t that worrying then? Let’s hear what our panel has to say!

JJO - Questions to Damien Belveze: (ppt ?)

Damien, as a University Librarian and User trainer, you run Information Literacy training courses for students to help them source, and assess, accurate information. 

## What do you think about these figures?

### short

- the fact that there is a growing confidence in science among the public can hide another fact : for a large part of the public, scepticism grows about people who embody the scientific endeavour, as it appears in a previous study published in LSE business[[@aksoyWhatEpidemicsTell2020]]

- people trust in science sometimes as a religion because they do not know enough how science works. They do not always perceive the difference between research and knowledge. Knowledge is research whose outputs have stabilized and are less and less discussed (for instance, smoking can provoke lung cancer), while research in an ongoing process where the consensus can be still altered by new discoveries.
  let's take the evolution theory initiated by Charles Darwin, when details of this theory are re-assessed through recent discoveries (like evolution times for a given species) some people put into question the theory itself, which by the way is not a theory (but the resume of our knowledge about evolution)


- familiarity with science (scientific information) is not correlated with acceptance of consensus on topics where values and lifestyles are questionned. Let's mention Dan Kahan's problem with scientific communication[[@KahanScienceCuriosityPolitical2017]]. a study published in Nature Communications earlier this year showed it national identification predicts lower support to health policy during a pandemic and science familiarity does not make a difference. This is also the case for climate change.

### long

 these results confirm a previous study, published in LSE business review on the first of June 2020, according to which being exposed to a pandemic outbreak, especially among young people, increases trust in scientific endeavour. But this study showed also that the growing trust in scientific endeavour is frequently linked to a paradoxical distrust in people who embody scientific undertaking. 

This lack of confidence in individuals (scholars, researchers) is not questioned in this plot.

If science seems to have gained some credit since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, we should not infere from that that scientists are more considered than before, especially among people who received less scientific education in their curriculum or left the education system earlier.

  

For those people, if the prestige of science has grown, discovering how science proceeds (lively discussion between scholars who do not agree (at least in the first stages of the outbreak) on how the disease spread and wether drugs such as chloroquine can heal this novel coronavirus) this can be disturbing for people who are used to think that science tells us something and that something will never change. For people unfamiliar with the way of producing knowledge via scientific methods (including peer review, ongoing debate, contradictory arguments…), this episode could have undermined confidence in scientists.

  

We could also mention another study by Dan Kahan, a researcher specialized in scientific communication who showed that there is no correlation between one’s familiarity with science and aknowledgement of the climate change. When you are a democrat, the more you are familiar with science, the more you think that climate change is real, whereas, when you are republican, on the contrary, a high confidence in science is more correlated with climate change denial. If you have a strong scientific culture, you are able to sophisticate enough in order to disqualify evidence held by opponants and to deceive yourself.


  

Information literacy is your speciality! How would you define fake news in a general context and in an academic context? (debatable scientific expertise vs general fake news)

the problem with the expression "fake news" is that it is used by politicians to label and disqualify news that contradict their opinions or their agenda. In this sense, fake news is a concept that can be measleading because only faintly tied to factuality. Most of the time, researchers that study spread of fake news use the work of fact-checkers like snopes or politifact to label tweets or blog posts as fake news or just news. 
The concept of fake news has its origin in the moral panic that followed trump election. Though it is unclear wether Trump was really elected because of this spread of fake news online (fuelled by Russians hackers or Macedonian youngsters ) or because his competitor and the democrat party had abandoned huge parts of the american population to their fate, what we call fake news here, was not necessary forged news (such as a picture reframed with a legend that has nothing to do with it, or a photograph on wich one element was photoshoped and diseappered). Most of the time, these news were real, but maybe amplified and sent to the right people, people who were profiled for years as good targets by mass surveillance, people who would not have voted, if they had not their timeline filled with snapshots of a self destroying and depressive society. There is a direct link between surveillance capitalism, analysed by Soshana Zuboff, and fake news efficiency. 
I prefer to consider a source as biased in some way. It can be the same way as I am myself biased or the contrary. what interests me as a librarian is to understand how people think, how I think myself, what biases impede us to think and undestand each other. 

What are the hallmarks of a “scientific authority” or expertise in the scientific field? (authority as a problematic concept)

How can a post-doctoral researcher know if they are reading a genuine source of information inside, and outside his/her field?

What resources are available for post-doctoral researchers who want to publish their research in reliable reviews? Can they contact you for assistance or advice?

How do you concretely train students to identify reliable information? (distinguishing between shades of science, then analysing tweets)

Damien, when we met to prepare this round table you mentioned you had a question for Vincent and Julien Giry? 

Question for Vincent Clavaud (from Damien):  
  
Do you think that fake labs (workshops in which students would try to forge fake pics or deep fakes) would be a good idea to make them aware of the problem of fake news?

  
Question for Julien Giry (from Damien):  
  
We’ve all seen journalists, academic advisors to the government or even politicians talk about conspiracy theories. These do exist, but there seems to be a danger in allowing the use of the term “conspiracy theory” to disqualify legitimate and relevant critics of the power system (as we see in Russia, where the concept of fake news and conspiracy seems to have been completely reversed). What are the safeguards in handling this concept?

  

Questions to Vincent Claveau: (ppt ?)

Vincent, as a CNRS Researcher at IRISA (the French Laboratory for Research and Innovation in Digital Science and Technology) one of your specialisations is detecting fake information in tweets, but also in many other types of content. 

What is your definition of “fake news”?

What are the current fake news topics you are working on?

What types of content are you working on?

How do we know if a tweet has been trafficked?

How do you work out if such or such content is reliable?

Do you think “[[Deepfake|Deepfakes]]” will become ubiquitous? Will they remain detectable?

How could language models like GPT-3 affect the generation of fake news? Do you think they will be able one day to generate a pseudo-scientific article from the existing literature that could be accepted in a peer-reviewed journal?

  

Questions to Julien Giry: (ppt oui)

Julien, your work as a Research Fellow at Tours University is very important in understanding the onset, and consequences, of conspiration theories. 

But first, what is your own take on the term “fake news”?

How worried should we really be about fake news/conspiration theories? (they seem to be everywhere)

How can you assess where users source their information from and what they do with that information? (survey results)

Do you also develop language analysis tools to help debunk fake news? 

How can researchers today join the public debate and avoid fostering conspiracy theories?

When preparing this round table, you told Janet and me that a great risk of scientific disinformation was distorted by the press, or legitimate experts of a specific field talking to the media outside their area of expertise. What advice would you give to post-doctoral researchers to avoid being misquoted? 

  

Any other questions between the round table members?

Could you comment on these tools, accessible to all, that can be used to detect fake news?

~~L'idéologie réactionnaire se pare en idéologie anti-système en récupérant les outils de la critique sociale, notamment la notion de déconstruction. 

~~déconstruire

~~Confusion : d'un côté, la déconstruction est attaquée par le pouvoir en place (cf. séminaire Blanquer)
d'un autre côté, la science est attaquée avec des arguments issus de la déconstruction qui servent à en relativiser les conclusions.
