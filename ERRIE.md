Les inviter à avoir des outils pour présenter leurs travaux 

regard de formateurs : comment peut-on bien communiquer l'information. 

Diapason 






# présentation2

University Librarians have always been involved in training students to find reliable sources and assess information, particularly since this information come to them across social networks or websites[[@ACRLFrameworkInformationLiteracy2015]].
Soon after the Trump election, the "Fake news" issue became central in the public debate, and Universities decided to oppose good science against an alledged rise of rumors on the internet and fake news. 
Now we are all conscious that rumors and fake news have been spreading long ago before Facebook and Twitter, and that thanks to works like Dominique Cardon's, the amount of disinformation is not as spectacular as what one can read in the news, but we know also that information wars can cost an election and social networks can be weaponized in an international conflict as the one which opposes Russia to Ukraine.

In courses where we used to teach undergraduates students to distinguish different shades of science (from the academic paper to the amateur's opinion, through disputes on Wikipedia or pubpeer), we tried to incorporate contents about mis or dis-information in the non-scientific media.

Focusing on social networks is the easiest part, because disinformation is traceable and we usually do not have enough time to explain how main media outlets are often economical biased. 
We usually present fragmented information to our students (a tweet for instance) and ask them to reframe and contextualize the claim.
We teach students to practice what it's called "lateral reading" : do not focus too much on the website, but make queries about the source & and the event to check if it has been covered by other sources, or if other sources we consider as reliable say something usefull about the author of the claim. This pedagogy is adapted to the hypertextual nature of the web and derived from constructivist tools.

Sometimes, when the claim is too recent to have been covered (or the source mostly unknown), we have to focus our attention on what is presented to us as evidence supporting a claim. Most of the time, it is an image, a photograph post on Facebook or Twitter. 
The most successful tweets contain emotionnal content such as pictures causing anger and indignation. 
Information literacy includes skill but also habits and soft skills such as stopping before sharing and checking one's emotions. 









# présentation

I train graduate and undergraduate students to assess information. Until recently, my colleagues and I have spend much time teaching students how to distinguish a paper written by a science journalist from a peer reviewed article. We have been insisting on formal characteristics such as inline citations, bibliography, footnotes, graphic plots. 
But this approach has shown its limits: 
1. a lot of papers that shows an academic design are not actually scientific papers
2. The rise of open access predatory publishing and on the other side, during the COVID-19 crisis the rapid growth of preprints and their use by physicians and decision lead us to spend more time on how scholarly communication should work and how it works actually. 

political use of scientific information can generate safe regulations on the benefit of the public, but a certain kind of science can also be weaponized by industrial stakeholders who want to convince -sometimes against scientific evidence- that their products are harmless. 

There is a large debate on social networks about how one can define expertise : is it the same thing as authority (see [[autorité#autorité et expertise]])
Do authority has inherent qualities, not depending from a given context (ACRL framework states that authority is constructed and contextual)
all along her career, an engineer or a physician may cumulate a great deal of expertise on some topics, but with students we must be sometimes reductionists and consider that in the public debate peer-reviewed academic works offer the most garanties that the guy or girl who is talking knows a bit about what she is talking about. 

In our training sessions, most of the time (not always) an expert on a topic is someone who has written several peer-reveiwed academic works on this topic, someone who comply with the standard way of producing, validating and communicating output. For instance, if the conversation comes to zoology, an expert will be a person who have written several papers in reknown peer-reviewed journals (in some fields, reknown still means, which has or had an impact factor, whatever it be)

When we believe something accordingly to our values, most of the time we need to convince ourselves that scientific research is aligned with our beliefs and our values. We go in search of rationalization. 
One problem is that many people do not see anymore science as a method to reduce uncertainty and widen our knowledge but as a pool of rationalizations. 

If there is a demand for rationalizations, opportunistic misinformers will respond to it (Kahan)

# critique de la notion de consensus

## consensus gap

L'idéologie réactionnaire se pare en idéologie anti-système en récupérant les outils de la critique sociale, notamment la notion de déconstruction. 

déconstruire

Confusion : d'un côté, la déconstruction est attaquée par le pouvoir en place (cf. séminaire Blanquer)
d'un autre côté, la science est attaquée avec des arguments issus de la déconstruction qui servent à en relativiser les conclusions.

# Les gardiens de la raison

## new information wars

quack advocates of miraculous cures usually do not pretend to rely their claims on scientific rules or when they do, they do it in such way that we can figure out that they don't actually know how science works. 
But more often

American Council on Science and Health (ACSH)

advocacy association who devotes itself to debunking junk science
<!-- devotes oneself to + ing / dedicate oneself to + ing -->

what is defined as *junk science* is every kind of scientific results that not confirms the innocuity of what corporations and industry groups want to keep on selling.
