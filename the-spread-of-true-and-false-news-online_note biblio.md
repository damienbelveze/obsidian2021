> "Contrary to conventional wisdom, robots accelerated the spread of true and false news at the same rate, implying that false news spreads more than the truth because humans, not robots, are more likely to spread it." ([Vosoughi, Roy and Aral 2018:7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TM3TYHNC?page=1))

> "We have therefore explicitly avoided the term fake news throughout this paper and instead use the more objectively verifiable terms "true" or "false" news. Although the terms fake news and misinformation also imply a willful distortion of the truth, we do not make any claims about the intent of the purveyors of the information in our analyses. We instead focus our attention on veracity and stories that have been verified as true or false." ([Vosoughi, Roy and Aral 2018:7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TM3TYHNC?page=1))

> "It took the truth about six times as long as falsehood to reach 1500 people" ([Vosoughi, Roy and Aral 2018:9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TM3TYHNC?page=3))

> "we conclude that human behavior contributes more to the differential spread of falsity and truth than automated robots do." ([Vosoughi, Roy and Aral 2018:11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TM3TYHNC?page=5))

> "This implies that misinformationcontainment policies should also emphasize behavioral interventions, like labeling and incentives to dissuade the spread of misinformation, rather than focusing exclusively on curtailing bots." ([Vosoughi, Roy and Aral 2018:11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TM3TYHNC?page=5))
