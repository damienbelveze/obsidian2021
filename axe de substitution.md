concept forgé par des linguistes pour exprimer que le sens d'un mot est en partie déterminé par le mot auquel il a été préféré : 

>When you write a sentence, and instead of writing you "don't recommend noticing" something you write "you don't recommend poring over" something the idea is that you wrote "poring over" to express something different than "noticing"
>Linguists talk about this as the "axis of substitution", the idea that the meaning of a word choice is produced in part by the words not chosen. When reading, you ask yourself "why did they choose this word and not another one?" and that helps you understand sentences.
