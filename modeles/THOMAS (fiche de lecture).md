## T
The T in THOMAS is **Topic**: the basics of the who, what, when and where. What the book is about






## H

The H in THOMAS is **Historiography**. What debates is this book intervening in? What does it add to/challenge in these conversations?

## O

The O in THOMAS is **Organization**. Is it thematic, chronological, innovative in any way? What can we learn by closely studying the table of contents about the hierarchy of the book's argument, or by looking at chapters' internal structure?

## M

The M in THOMAS is **Methodology**. What methods does this book use, which archives, what approach does it take to analyzing its sources?

## A

The A in THOMAS is the **Argument**, and where we usually spend the most time of course. A simple statement of the book's argument is often surprisingly elusive, but we also consider beyond that how the THOM part of our discussion creates the Argument in different ways

## S

Finally the S in THOMAS is **"So What?"** or alternatively Stakes or Significance. For readers who have no interest in the specifics of the Topic of even the Argument, why would this book be useful? This is where the conversation usually gets the most interesting
